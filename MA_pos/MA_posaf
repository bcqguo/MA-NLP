ment initiatives.  problem loan and repossessed asset costs declined due to the overall decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed assets, and lower levels of classified loans. directors' and regional board fees are down due to: 1) lower rsu vesting expense mostly attributable to nonrecurring rsu grants and, 2) lower director retirement expense due to acceleration of service costs in

investment securities available for sale, overnight funds sold and due from frb, and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, net of valuation allowance.cash and cash equivalents.  cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.cash and cash equivalents are used for daily cash management purposes, management of short-term interest rate opportunities, and liquidity.cash and cash equivalents as of june30, 2015 were $64.8 million compared to $103.6 million at december31, 2014 and consisted mainly of deposits with the frb.the company has used its cash and cash equivalents to partially fund loan origination activity.investment securities.  our investment portfolio at june30, 2015 consisted primarily of u.s. agency, mortgage-backed securities (‚Äúmbs‚Äù), and asset-backed securities ("abs").  repayment of principal and interest of the abs is dependent upon the performance of the underlying loan collateral.  the company performs due diligence of each security on a pre- and post-purchase basis to evaluate the underlying collateral and invests in the investment grade tranches of securitizations.  however, should defaults or loss severities exceed the credit enhancement in the structure, payment of principal or interest may be impacted.   the company currently does not own any collateralized loan obligation securities that would require divestiture under the volcker rule of the dodd-frank act.  the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own account; and from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, referred to as ‚Äúcovered funds‚Äù.our available for sale securities are reported at fair value and are used primarily for liquidity, pledging, earnings, and asset / liability management purposes and are reviewed quarterly for possible impairment.due to portfolio activity, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities at june30, 2015 decreased $92.0 million or 30.5% to $210.2 million compared to $302.2 million at december31, 2014.  the proceeds from investment security sales partially funded the loan portfolio growth.loans.  as a holding company of two community banks, we have a primary objective of meeting the business and consumer credit needs within our markets where standards of profitability, client relationships, and credit quality intersect.  our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment loans.  lending decisions are based upon evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan.  personal guarantees are required on most loans; however, prudent exceptions are made on occasion based upon the financial viability of the borrowing entity or the underlying project that is being financed.gross loans increased by $106.1 million or 7.5% during the six months ended june30, 2015. this growth was primarily driven by a $104.7 million marine loan portfolio purchase, arranged by the shore premier finance marine lending unit, of which $75.3 million were installment loans and $29.4 million were commercial loans. it is the intent of the company to continue to grow the loan portfolio through originations in all the markets we serve. credit concentrations are measured against internal and prudential regulatory guidelines.  additionally, our prudent business practices and internal guidelines and underwriting standards will continue to be followed in making lending decisions in order to manage exposure to credit-related losses.allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.  the allowance for loan losses was $27.7 million or 1.81% of outstanding loans as of june30, 2015 compared with $27.1 million or 1.90% of outstanding loans as of december31, 2014.the allowance for loan losses increased $686 thousand, or 2.5%, during the six months ended june30, 2015 as a result of recoveries exceeding charge-offs, and additional provisions for loan losses.  our provision for loan losses was $600 thousand during the six months ended june30, 2015, compared to $100 thousand recorded for the same period in 2014. we did not make any significant changes to our methodology or model for estimating the allowance for loan losses during this most recent quarter or during any of the past three years.53table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditionthe allowance consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. table 4 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and other related information at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014.table 4:allowance for loan losses components and related data(in thousands, except for percentages)june 30,

% of nonaccrual loans67.83125.77the specific component of our allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, are individually evaluated for impairment.the specific component increased during the six months ended june30, 2015, primarily due to the decision by management to move into default the company's largest remaining substandard relationship.  this decision also drove impaired loans to increase to $70.7 million at june30, 2015 from $48.9 million at december31, 2014.of these loans, $40.9 million were on nonaccrual status at june30, 2015 as compared with $21.5 million at december31, 2014, an increase of 90.1%.  the general or pooled component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and collectively evaluated for impairment.  the combination of lower historical loss rates and recoveries continuing to exceed charge offs drove a decline in general reserves.  strong net recoveries helped to build the total reserve by offsetting some provisioning that would have been necessary otherwise.  a provision for loan losses of $600 thousand was added to the total reserve during the first six months of 2015.  an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses.  the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance increased mainly due to macroeconomic indicators, particularly gdp measures, which indicated a sharp reduction in economic growth. table 5 displays certain ratios used by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014.table 5:adequacy of the allowance for loan lossesjune30, 2015december31, 2014non-performing loans for which

contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditionat june30, 2015, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses to be commensurate with the risk existing in our portfolio.  however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations. non-performing assets.  management classifies non-performing assets as those loans on which payments have been delinquent 90 days and are still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, and other real estate and repossessed assets.total non-performing assets were $54.0 million and $43.2 million at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.  our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of non-performing assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 3.36% and 2.95% at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.  at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014 there were no loans categorized as 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.loans in nonaccrual status totaled $40.9 million and $21.5 million at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.  the company‚Äôs largest borrower, as measured by total exposure, was downgraded to substandard in the third quarter of 2014, and was placed in nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2015.  excluding the impact of this one relationship moving into nonaccrual status, our non-performing assets ratio would have been 2.02% at june 30, 2015, continuing the downward trend in nonaccrual loans.  loans are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, part of the balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans  reach 90 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless there are extenuating circumstances.  we had $13.1 million and $21.7 million of other real estate owned and repossessed assets at june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.this decline was mainly due to sales of real estate owned outpacing foreclosure and repossession activity during the first six months of 2015.deposits.  deposits increased $93.1 million or 5.9% from december31, 2014.  the company has made a concerted effort to attract additional deposits in order to support planned and anticipated loan growth.  approximately half of the deposit growth came from the addition of one commercial deposit relationship obtained through the company's expansion into baltimore, md.borrowings.  we use short-term and long-term borrowings from various sources including the frb discount window, fhlb, and trust preferred securities.we manage the level of our borrowings to ensure that we have adequate sources of liquidity.refer to our 2014 form 10-k for further discussion about our borrowings.liquidity.  liquidity represents an institution‚Äôs ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management.it is used by management to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds.we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during the six months ended june30, 2015.  at june30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $64.8 million, and investment securities available for sale, at fair value were $210.2 million.at june30, 2015, our banks had credit lines in the amount of $228.4 million at the fhlb with advances of $67.5 million utilized.these lines may be utilized for short- and/or long-term borrowing.at june30, 2015, all our fhlb borrowings mature by september 2015.we also possess additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements.the banks also maintain federal funds lines with three regional banking institutions and through the frb discount window.these available lines totaled approximately $88.7 million at june30, 2015, and none of these lines were utilized for borrowing purposes at june30, 2015.capital resources.  total shareholders‚Äô equity increased $6.1 million or 3.1% to $203.6 million at june30, 2015, from $197.5 million at december31, 2014.  the company and the banks are subject to regulatory capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures to ensure capital adequacy.tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders‚Äô equity before non-controlling interest, plus qualified trust preferred securities, plus net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, less intangible assets.  total risk-based capital adds qualifying allowances for loan losses.common equity tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders‚Äô equity before non-controlling interest, less intangible assets.as of june30, 2015, our consolidated regulatory capital ratios were common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.52%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.12%, total risk-based capital ratio of 14.37%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.18%.as of june30, 2015, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums, and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the banks' common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio were as follows: 12.62%, 12.62%, 13.88%, and 10.90%, respectively for bohr and 12.22%, 12.22%, 13.16%, and 9.68%, respectively for shore.55table of contentshampton

informationitem 3 - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate sensitivitymarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the company.fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company‚Äôs interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.the primary goal of our asset/liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment.our ability to manage our interest rate risk depends generally on our ability to match the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income.our management, guided by alco, determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.these decisions are based on management‚Äôs expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.the primary method that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets and liabilities over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures.this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon.key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments.the table below illustrates the expected effect on net interest income for the twelve months following june30, 2015 and december31, 2014 due to an immediate change in interest rates.estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions, such as those previously discussed.effect on net interest incomejune 30, 2015december 31, 2014change in net interest incomechange in net interest income(in thousands, except for percentages)amount%amount%change in

increase in net interest income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment.as of december31, 2014, we projected an increase in net interest income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment.it should be noted, however, that the simulation analysis is based upon equivalent changes in interest rates for all categories of assets and liabilities.in normal operating conditions, interest rate changes rarely occur in such a uniform manner.many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments.in addition, management may deploy strategies that offset some of the impact of changes in interest rates.dependent upon timing and shifts in the interest rate term structure, certain rising rate scenarios are less favorable due to lower levels of assets with short-term re-pricing characteristics, as well as due to the variable rate structure on the majority of our borrowings and the floors on many loans that will cause a delay in any interest income improvement. consequently, variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis.management utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over varying time horizons. the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a flat-rate case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest. these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet mix, pricing and the re-pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet.57table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.  financial informationitem 4 - controls and

on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations except as provided below.on november 21, 2014, in the matter of scott c. harvard v. shore bank et al (cl13-4525-00), the circuit court for the city of norfolk, virginia ruled that former shore bank president scott c. harvard was entitled to $655,495.43 in severance pay, plus interest from may 20, 2014, and $155,000.00 in attorney‚Äôs fees, plus additional fees incurred since july 15, 2014. mr. harvard had initiated the claim in june 2013 alleging that the company and shore bank were contractually obligated to make certain severance payments to him following the termination of his employment in 2009.  the company asserts that mr. harvard was not entitled to a ‚Äúgolden parachute‚Äù severance due to application of a regulation under the tarp program and furthermore, that based upon the legally distinct entity from which harvard derived his compensation, shore bank did not owe harvard severance compensation. the judge ruled in favor of harvard that the prohibition of the payment of his contracted severance compensation was a taking of his private property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment to the constitution, and further that the company was prohibited from making the argument, based upon the doctrine of judicial estoppel, that shore bank was legally distinct from the holding company that employed mr. harvard. the company was awarded a petition for appeal on june 10, 2015 in the supreme court of virginia.  it is expected arguments will be heard later in 2015.on june 25, 2015, in the matter of julie anderson v. bank of hampton roads, inc. and hampton roads bankshares, inc (cl15-6659), a former employee filed a complaint in norfolk circuit court, alleging a breach of contract for failure to pay severance benefits.  the plaintiff is seeking $926,776.46, plus pre- and post-judgment interest and attorney's fees and expenses. the company filed a notice of removal of the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia on july 20, 2015 and the federal court assigned it case no. 2:15cv00323-awa-dem. the company filed a motion

 financial informationitem 1.  notes to consolidated financial statementsnote a - basis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of hampton roads bankshares, inc., (the ‚Äúcompany,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù), have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for interim financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-q.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements.  in the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation.  the results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  the company has two banking subsidiaries, bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù, collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù), which constitute substantially all of the company‚Äôs assets and operations. for further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the company‚Äôs annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 (‚Äú2014 form 10-k‚Äù).use of estimates in the preparation of financial statementsthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  actual results could differ from those estimates. material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, determination of fair value for financial instruments, and tax assets, liabilities, and expensesrecent accounting pronouncementsin january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables - troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon a foreclosure, which clarifies when banks and similar institutions (creditors) should reclassify mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties from the loan portfolio to other real estate owned (oreo). the asu defines when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure has occurred and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. this asu allows for prospective or modified retrospective application. the effective date for public business entities is for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted.  the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.during the second quarter of 2014, asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (‚Äúnew revenue standard‚Äù), was issued. asu 2014-09 represents a comprehensive reform of many of the revenue recognition requirements in gaap. the asu creates a new topic within the accounting standards codification (‚Äúasc‚Äù), topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. the new revenue standard will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and supersedes or amends much of the industry-specific revenue recognition guidance found throughout the asc. the core principle of the new revenue standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. the asu creates a five-step process for achieving that core principle: (1) identifying the contract with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue when an entity has completed the performance obligations. the asu also requires additional disclosures that allow users of the financial statements to understand the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows resulting from contracts with customers. the guidance in the asu is effective for the company on january 1, 2017. the new revenue standard permits the use of retrospective or cumulative effect transition methods. it appears that a majority of the company‚Äôs contracts with customers (i.e., financial instruments) do not fall within the scope of the new revenue standard.  therefore, the company does not expect the asu to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs reported financial results.8table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes

agency securities, and eight asset-backed securities, compared with unrealized losses totaling $1.9 million at december31, 2014, which included five corporate securities, twelve mortgage-backed agency securities, and eighteen asset-backed securities.in instances where an unrealized loss did occur, there was no indication of an adverse change in credit on any of the underlying securities in the tables above. management believes no individual unrealized loss represented an other-than-temporary impairment as of those dates. the company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell, the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.at march 31, 2015, none of the equity securities experienced unrealized losses compared with one of the equity securities experienced an unrealized loss totaling $9 thousand at december 31, 2014.  the company‚Äôs unrealized losses on equity securities were caused by what management deems to be transitory fluctuations in market valuation.10table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes to consolidated financial statementsother-than-temporary impairment (‚Äúotti‚Äù)during the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the investment securities available for sale were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired; therefore, no losses were recognized through noninterest income.management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.in determining otti, management considers many factors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.the assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.when otti occurs, the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss.if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss, the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment‚Äôs amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.maturities of investment securitiesthe amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity of investment securities available for sale that are not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 are shown below.expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, which are not due at

(‚Äúfhlb‚Äù)the company‚Äôs investment in fhlb stock totaled $7.2 million at march 31, 2015 and $9.2 million at december31, 2014.fhlb stock is generally viewed as a long-term investment and as a restricted investment security because it is required to be held in order to access fhlb advances (i.e. borrowings).it is carried at cost as there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb or member institutions.therefore, when evaluating fhlb stock for impairment, its value is based on ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value.the company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014, and no impairment has been recognized.federal reserve bank

majority of this amount and is generally viewed as a long-term investment and as a restricted investment security as it is required to be held to effect membership in the federal reserve system.it is carried at cost as there is not an active market or exchange for the stock other than the frb or member institutions.the company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily

full range of commercial, real estate, and consumer loans described in further detail below.our loan portfolio is comprised of the following categories:commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment.our primary lending objective is to meet business and consumer needs in our market areas while maintaining our standards of profitability and credit quality and enhancing client relationships.all lending decisions are based upon a thorough evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan.with few exceptions, personal guarantees are required on all loans.during 2012 and 2013, the company purchased several portfolios of loans secured by boats totaling $55.7 million that are classified as installment loans.  in may 2014, shore launched shore premier finance ("spf"), a specialty finance unit that specializes in marine financing for u.s. coast guard documented vessels to customers throughout the united states.  through direct marine loan originations, as well as purchases of existing portfolios of marine loans, the company's intention is to significantly grow the installment loan portion of its loan portfolio. in fact, during the first quarter of 2015, spf arranged a $104.8 million marine loan portfolio purchase, of which $75.3 million were classified as installment loans and $29.4 million were commercial floor plan loans classified as commercial and industrial. the total of our loans by segment at march 31, 2015 and

portfolio and is directionally consistent with the change in the quality of our loan portfolio.however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations.impaired loanstotal impaired loans were $49.6 million and $48.9 million at march 31, 2015, and december31, 2014, respectively.the company continues to resolve its troubled loans through charge-offs, curtailments, pay offs, and returns of loans to performing status.  collateral dependentimpaired loans were $44.1 million and $43.3 million at march 31, 2015, and december31, 2014, respectively, and are measured at the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.  impaired loans for which no allowance is provided totaled $29.6 million and $29.1 million at march 31, 2015, and december31, 2014, respectively.loans written down to their estimated fair value of collateral less the costs to sell account for $6.9 million and$7.6 million of the impaired loans for which no allowance has been provided as of march 31, 2015, and december31, 2014, respectively.  the weighted average age of appraisals for collateral dependent loans is 0.41 and 0.56 years at march31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.the remaining impaired loans for which no allowance is provided are expected to be fully covered by the fair value of the collateral, and therefore, no loss is expected on these loans.the following charts show

contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes to consolidated financial statementsloans that are considered tdrs are considered specifically impaired and the primary consideration for measurement of impairment is the present value of the expected cash flows.however, given the prevalence of real estate secured loans in the company‚Äôs portfolio of troubled assets, the majority of the company‚Äôs tdr loans are ultimately considered collateral-dependent.as a practical expedient, impairments are, therefore, calculated based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and observable market prices for the sale of the respective notes are not considered as a basis for impairment for any of the company‚Äôs loans.in determining the estimated fair valueof collateral dependent impaired loans, the company uses third party appraisals and, if necessary, utilizes a proprietary database of its own historical property appraisals in conjunction with external data and applies a relevant discount derived from analysis of appraisals of similar property type, vintage, and geographic location (for example, in situations where the most recent available appraisal is aged and an updated appraisal has not yet been received).the company does not participate in any government or company sponsored tdr programs and holds no corresponding assets.rather, loans are individually modified in situations where the company believes it will minimize the probability of losses to the company.additionally, the company had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing receivables whose terms have been modified in tdrs at march 31, 2015.note f - other real estate owned and repossessed assetsthe following table shows a rollforward of

1.  notes to consolidated financial statementsnote i - derivative instrumentsderivatives are a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying assets.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.in connection with the underwriting process, the company enters into commitments to lock-in the interest rate of the loan with the borrower prior to funding (‚Äúinterest rate lock commitments‚Äù).generally, such interest rate lock commitments are for periods less than 60 days.these interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives.the company manages its exposure to changes in fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments by entering into simultaneous agreements to sell the residential loans to third party investors shortly after their origination and funding.at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company had loans held for sale of $55.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively.under the contractual relationship in the best efforts method, the company is obligated to sell the loans only if the loans close. as a result of the terms of these contractual relationships, the company is not exposed tochanges in fair value nor will it realize gains related to its rate-lock commitments due to subsequent changes in interest rates.at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company had rate-lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans (unfunded par amount of loans) on a best efforts basis in the amounts of $88.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively.additionally, to meet the needs of its commercial customers, the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.derivative contracts are executed between the company and certain commercial loan customers with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program enabling the commercial loan customers to effectively exchange variable-rate interest payments under their existing obligations for fixed-rate interest payments.for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, the company recorded gains totaling $173 thousand and $79 thousand, respectively, related to trading income on the interest rate swaps included in the back-to-back swap program that was included within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.as of march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, the company has derivative financial instruments not included in hedge relationships. these derivatives consist of interest rate swaps to facilitate interest rate management strategies for both the company and its commercial borrowers. certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet and/or subject to master netting arrangements. the company‚Äôs derivative transactions with financial institution counterparties are generally executed under international swaps and derivative association (isda) master agreements which include right of setoff provisions. in such cases there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and there may be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis. nonetheless, the company does not generally offset financial instruments for financial reporting purposes. information about financial instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 is presented in the

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.the company classifies financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.valuation methodologies for the fair value hierarchy are as follows.level 1 ‚Äì quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.level 2 ‚Äì observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose values are determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.level 3 ‚Äì unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.level 3 assets and liabilities include values that are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.the categorization of an asset or liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.recurring basisthe company measures or monitors certain of its assets on a fair value basis.fair value is used on a recurring basis for those assets and liabilities for which an election was made as well as for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting.the following tables reflect the fair value of assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014.27table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes to

company‚Äôs policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.the following describes the valuation techniques used to estimate fair value for our assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis.investment securities available for sale.where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products, and exchange traded equities.if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.level 2 securities would include u.s. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed, and other securities valued using third party quoted prices in markets that are not active.in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.derivative loan commitments.the company originates mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis.under the best efforts basis, the company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate is fixed prior to funding.these commitments, in which the company intends to sell in the secondary market, are considered freestanding derivatives.the fair values of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as level 3, are based on quoted prices adjusted for commitments that the company does not expect to fund.interest rate swaps. the company uses observable inputs to determine fair value of its interest rate swaps.the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques that are based on discounted cash flow analysis using the expected cash flows of each derivative over the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and market-based interest rate curves.  the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments.the variable cash payments were based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.accordingly, the company categorizes these financial instruments within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.nonrecurring basiscertain assets, specifically collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment and an allowance is established to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value).the adjustments are based on appraisals of underlying collateral or other observable market prices when current appraisals or observable market prices are available.where we do not have an appraisal that is less than 29table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes to consolidated financial statements12 months old, an existing appraisal or other valuation would be utilized after discounting it to reflect current market conditions, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value.to assist in the discounting process, a valuation matrix was developed to provide valuation guidance for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned where it was deemed that an existing appraisal was outdated as to current market conditions.the matrix applies discounts to external appraisals depending on the type of real estate and age of the appraisal.the discounts are generally specific point estimates; however in some cases, the matrix allows for a small range of values.the discounts were based in part upon externally derived statistical data.the discounts were also based upon management‚Äôs knowledge of market conditions and prices of sales of other real estate owned.in addition, matrix value adjustments may be made by our independent appraisal group to reflect property value trends within specific markets as well as actual sales data from market transactions and/or foreclosed real estate sales.it is the company‚Äôs policy to classify these as level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy.the weighted average age of appraisals for valuations of collateral dependent impaired loans was 0.41 years as of march31, 2015 and 0.56 years as of december 31, 2014.management periodically reviews the discounts in the matrix as compared to valuations from updated appraisals and modifies the discounts accordingly should updated appraisals reflect valuations significantly different than those derived utilizing the matrix.to date, management believes the appraisal discount matrix has resulted in appropriate adjustments to existing appraisals thereby providing management with reasonable valuations for the collateral underlying the loan portfolio; however, while appraisals are indicators of fair value, the amount realized upon sale of these assets could be significantly different.the following tables reflect the fair valueof assets measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at march 31, 2015

loans.the majority of the company‚Äôs impaired loans are considered collateral dependent. for collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.  due to the nature of real-estate appraisals and the discounts applied by the company in determining fair value of the underlying collateral as described previously, collateral-dependent loans are considered level 3 financial instruments. other real estate owned and repossessed assets.the adjustments to other real estate owned and repossessed assets are based primarily on appraisals of the real estate or other observable market prices.our policy is that fair values for these assets are based on current appraisals.in most cases, we maintain current appraisals for these items.where we do not have a current appraisal, an existing appraisal would be utilized after discounting it to reflect changes in market conditions from the date of the existing appraisal, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value.30table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial

reflect current marketconditions, abbreviated holdingperiod, and estimated costs to sellother fair value measurementsadditionally, accounting standards require the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value. for the financial instruments that the company does not record at fair value, estimates of fair value are made at a point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument.no readily available market exists for a significant portion of the company‚Äôs financial instruments.fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, interest rate risk characteristics, and other factors. many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument.in addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates.the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating fair value of these financial instruments.(a)cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(b)investment securities available for salefair values are based on published market prices where available. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow.investment securities available for sale are carried at their aggregate fair value.(c)restricted equity securitiesthese investments are carried at cost as there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb, frb, or member institutions.  the carrying amount approximates fair value.(d)loans held for salethe carrying value of loans held for sale is a reasonable estimate of fair value since loans held for sale are expected to be sold within a short period.(e)loansto determine the fair values of loans other than those listed as nonaccrual, we use discounted cash flow analyses.in these analyses, we use discount rates that are similar to the interest rates and terms currently being offered to borrowers of similar terms and credit 31table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem 1.  notes to consolidated financial statementsquality.for nonaccrual loans, we use a variety of techniques to measure fair value, such as using the current appraised value of the collateral, discounting the contractual cash flows, and analyzing market data that we may adjust due to the specific characteristics of the loan or collateral.(f)interest receivable and interest payablethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(g)bank-owned life insurancethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(h)depositsthe fair values disclosed for transaction deposits such as demand and savings accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (this is, their carrying values).the carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date.fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on comparable instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.(i)borrowingsthe fair value of borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.these include fhlb borrowings and other borrowings.(j)commitments to extend credit and standby letters of creditthe only amounts recorded for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are the deferred fees arising from these unrecognized financial instruments.these deferred fees are not deemed significant at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014, and as such, the related fair values have not been estimated.the carrying amounts and fair values of

success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members;‚Ä¢we are not paying dividends on our common stock currently and absent regulatory approval are prevented from doing so.  the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;‚Ä¢we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.  while we returned to profitability in 2013 and continued to be profitable during 2015, we can make no assurances that will continue.  an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels;‚Ä¢our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations;‚Ä¢economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition;‚Ä¢virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock;‚Ä¢our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations;‚Ä¢our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry;‚Ä¢sales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price;‚Ä¢the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss;‚Ä¢general economic conditions in the markets in which we do business may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;‚Ä¢we have had large numbers of problem loans, relative to our peers.  although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so;‚Ä¢the determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected;‚Ä¢our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk;‚Ä¢we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability;‚Ä¢we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams;34table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial condition‚Ä¢our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area;‚Ä¢our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities;‚Ä¢banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors;‚Ä¢the fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;‚Ä¢government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;‚Ä¢proposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans; and‚Ä¢the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.our forward-looking statements could be incorrect in light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.the future events, developments, or results described in this report could turn out to be materially different.we have no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements after the date of this report and you should not expect us to do so.critical accounting policiesu.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex assumptions, judgments, and estimates.our assumptions, judgments, and estimates may be incorrect, and changes in such assumptions, judgments, and estimates may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.actual results, in fact, could differ materially from those estimates.we consider our policies on allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred taxes, and the valuation of other real estate owned to be critical accounting policies.  refer to our 2014 form 10-k for further discussion of these policies.material trends and uncertaintiesthe company's largest market in which it does business, the hampton roads region of virginia, continues to see a slow but steadily improving economy.  according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the hampton roads unemployment rate was 5.6% in february 2015, compared to 6.1% in february 2014, and total non-farm employment rose 0.7% from february 2014 to february 2015.  the housing market showed signs of strength.  according to the real estate information network, existing home sales rose 32% in march 2015 compared to march 2014, with the median price of existing homes increasing 6%.  distressed home sales declined to 22.7% of all homes sales in march 2015, down from 25% in march 2014.there was a general market expectation that the federal reserve would begin the normalization of interest rates by june 2015.  however, first quarter 2015 u.s. economic data which showed slowing economic growth, slow wage growth, and stubbornly low inflation could put those plans on hold.  a reading of the minutes from the federal open market committee‚Äôs march 17 and march 18 meetings supports a growing consensus that the federal reserve may wait until september 2015, and possibly later, to start raising interest rates.  based on this information, we expect the low interest rate environment to continue through the remainder of 2015.the loan portfolio grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by a $104.8 million marine loan portfolio purchase, executed by our shore premier finance unit, of which $75.3 million were installment loans and $29.4 million were commercial loans.  despite a modest increase in non-performing and impaired loans in the first quarter, classified loans continued to decline, and overall credit quality, as measured by weighted average risk grade, continued the trend of improvement as well. with mortgage loan rates declining during the first quarter of 2015, there was an increase in demand for refinancing, which drove mortgage banking revenue up 133.2% over the same period last year. strong growth in deposits continued in the first quarter expanding by $102.1 million, or 6.5%.  for further discussion of the material trends and uncertainties that may affect our results and financial condition, refer to the risk factors contained part ii item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù in this report.company overviewhampton

(the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in virginia beach, virginia.  the company‚Äôs primary subsidiaries are bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù).  the banks engage in general community and commercial banking business, targeting the needs of individuals and small- to medium-35table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditionsized businesses in our primary service areas.  currently, bohr operates 17 full-service offices in the hampton roads region of southeastern virginia and 10 full-service offices throughout richmond, virginia and the northeastern and research triangle regions of north carolina that do business as gateway bank (‚Äúgateway‚Äù).  shore operates 7 full-service offices in the eastern shore of virginia and maryland and 3 loan production offices in maryland and delaware.  through various divisions, the banks also offer mortgage banking and marine financing.  our largest investor shareholders include anchorage capital group, l.l.c. (‚Äúanchorage‚Äù), capgen capital group vi lp (‚Äúcapgen‚Äù), and the carlyle group, l.p. (‚Äúcarlyle‚Äù).  anchorage, capgen, and carlyle own 24.84%, 29.89%, and 24.84%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march 31, 2015.our primary source of revenue is net interest income earned by our bank subsidiaries.  net interest income represents interest and fees earned from lending and investment activities less the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  net interest income may be impacted by variations in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the yields earned and the rates paid, level of non-performing assets, and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support earning assets.  in addition to net interest income, noninterest income is another important source of revenue.  noninterest income is derived primarily from service charges on deposits and mortgage banking revenue.  gains and losses on the sale or impairment of our other real estate owned and repossessed assets are recognized in noninterest income.  other significant factors that impact net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. are the provision for loan losses, and noninterest expense.the direct lending activities in which the company engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. as such, interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve") and general economic conditions, nationally and in the company's primary market areas, have a significant impact on the company's results of operations. to the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the company in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the company. regarding net interest margin, the company makes fixed rate loans, whereby general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce the company's spread as the interest rates the company must pay for deposits may increase while interest income may be unchanged. economic conditions may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans and the ability to liquidate that property to satisfy a loan if necessary.the company's goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures and modifying those policies on occasion to account for changing or emerging risks or changing market conditions, evaluating each borrower's business plan and financial condition during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and maintaining sufficient collateral to mitigate economic loss in the event of liquidation. an allowance for loan losses has been established which consists of general, specific, and unallocated components. a risk rating system is employed to estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general reserve allocations.  the general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for specific impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated for potential loss.  the specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment.  the specific allowance for loan losses is based on a loan-by-loan analysis and varies between impaired loans largely due to the value of the loan‚Äôs underlying collateral.  an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses and considers internal portfolio management effectiveness and external macroeconomic factors.overview of results of operations and financial conditionthe following commentary provides information about the major components of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources.this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.  however, the markets in which we operate have begun to experience generally more stable business conditions.  the levels of loan delinquencies and defaults have continued to decline over the last several years, although they continue to be higher than historical levels.  during this period, our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown.the company reported net income for the three months ended march 31, 2015, as it did for all of 2014 and 2013, compared to reporting net operating losses for 2010 to 2012, primarily resulting from improved general economic conditions and credit performance of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio.there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates.as of march31, 2015, the 36table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditioncompany exceeded the regulatory capital minimums and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the following is a summary of our financial condition as of march31, 2015 and our financial performance for the three months then ended.‚Ä¢assets were $2.1 billion at march31, 2015.total assets increased by $67.1 million or 3.4% from december31, 2014.the increase in assets was primarily associated with a $111.9 million or 7.9% increase in gross loans, a $33.4 million or 151.3% increase in loans held for sale, offset by a $67.7 million or 22.4% decrease in investment securities available for sale, a $4.4 million or 5.2% decrease in overnight funds sold and due from frb, and a $3.8 million or 17.7% decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed assets, net of valuation allowance.‚Ä¢investment securities available for sale were $234.5 million as of march31, 2015, down from $302.2 million at december31, 2014.the proceeds from investment security sales partially funded the loan portfolio growth during the quarter.  a general decrease in interest rates contributed to an increase in the net unrealized gains in our portfolio.‚Ä¢the growth in gross loans was primarily driven by a $104.8 million marine loan portfolio purchase; of which $75.3 million were installment loans and $29.4 million were commercial loans.impaired loans modestly increased by $788 thousand, or 1.6% to $49.6 million at march 31, 2015, compared to $48.9 million at december 31, 2014.‚Ä¢allowance for loan losses increased $1.1 million, or 4.2% to $28.2 million at march31, 2015; up from $27.1 million at december31, 2014.  the combination of a longer historical loss look-back period, lengthening loss emergence periods in certain loan categories, and substantial loan portfolio growth necessitated an increase in general reserves.  a modest rise in non-performing and impaired loans increased specific reserves.  recoveries outpaced charge-offs during the quarter, which helped build the total reserve.‚Ä¢deposits increased $102.1 million or 6.5% from december31, 2014, as a result of increases of $53.1 million or 18.0% in time deposits over $100 thousand, increases of $25.1 million or 9.4% in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, increases of $12.0 million or 1.9% in interest-bearing demand deposits, increases of $8.3 million or 2.4% in time deposits less than $100 thousand, and increases of $3.6 million or 6.4% in savings deposits.  the company has made a concerted effort to attract additional deposits in order to support loan growth.  approximately half of the deposit growth came from the addition of one commercial deposit relationship obtained through the company's expansion into baltimore, md.‚Ä¢net interest income decreased $264 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. several factors contributed to this decline.  average interest-earning assets grew by $113.4 million; however, the average yield on these assets declined 24 basis points. interest-bearing deposits grew $94.2 million, with the average rate paid on these deposits increasing 7 basis points.  net interest margin was 3.14% at march 31, 2015, compared to 3.40% at march 31, 2014.  this decline was primarily driven by the lower average yield earned on loans, as well as increased average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.‚Ä¢a provision for losses for the three months ended march 31, 2015 was recorded for $600 thousand, compared to $100 thousand for the same period in 2014.  the need for an increase in the provision expense came as a result of significant portfolio growth and a modest increase in non-performing and impaired loans during the quarter.‚Ä¢noninterest income for the three months ended march 31, 2015 was $6.5 million, a decline of $849 thousand or 11.6% compared to the same period in 2014.  major drivers of this decline included a decrease of $2.9 million in income from bank-owned life insurance; a decrease of $145 thousand in gain on sale of other real estate owned and repossessed assets; and an increase of $598 thousand in other than temporary impairment of other real estate owned and repossessed assets.  mortgage banking revenue experienced healthy growth of $2.4 million or 133.2%. ‚Ä¢the company's return on average assets ratio (roaa) was 0.26%, and 0.80% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and its return on average equity ratio (roae) was 2.66% and 8.25% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.‚Ä¢our effective tax rate was 2.10% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 compared to 0.2% for the same period in 2014.these taxes related to state income taxes owed.these rates differ from the statutory rate due primarily to the valuation allowance against the company‚Äôs deferred tax assets.37table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditionanalysis of results of operationsnet income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three months ended march 31, 2015 was $1.3 million, as compared with net income of $3.9 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014.net interest income and net interest marginnet interest income, a major component of our earnings, is the difference between the income generated by interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.net interest margin, which is calculated by expressing net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, is an indicator of effectiveness in generating income from earning assets.  interest-earning assets consist of loans, investment securities, overnight funds sold and due from frb, and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.  interest-bearing liabilities consist of deposit accounts and borrowings. net interest income and net interest margin may be significantly impacted by the market interest rates (rate); the mix, duration, and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume); changes in the yields earned and rates paid; and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support interest-earning assets.our management team strives to maximize net interest income through prudent balance sheet administration and by maintaining appropriate risk levels as determined by our asset / liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù) and the board of directors.  table 1 presents the average interest-earning assets and liabilities, the average yields earned on such assets and rates paid on such liabilities, net interest margin, and income and expense variances caused by changes in average balances and rates for the indicated periods.table 1:average balance sheet and net interest margin analysisthree months ended march 31, 2015three

contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditioninterest income on loans, including fees, increased predominantly as a result of an increase in average loan balances; however, this growth was offset by a decline in the average yield earned on loans.interest income on investment securities decreased due to decline in the overall size of the average investment portfolio, as we partially funded the loan portfolio growth with proceeds from investment security sales.interest expense on deposits increased mainly due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, as well as an increase in the average rate paid on time deposits. interest expense on borrowings, which consisted of fhlb borrowings and other borrowings, decreased mainly due to maturing fhlb advances being paid down. noninterest incomenoninterest income comprised 26.4% of total revenue during the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 28.9% during the three months ended march 31, 2014.we define total revenue as the sum of interest income and noninterest income.  table 2 provides a summary of

2015, as compared to 32.0% for the same period in 2014.  income from bank-owned life insurance declined due to death benefits received in excess of cash surrender value in the first quarter of 2014,

increase of $598 thousand in other than temporary impairment of other real estate owned and repossessed assets was driven by updated market values for properties owned, as well as establishing a currency valuation allowance for the one property we own in canada.noninterest expensenoninterest expense represents our operating and overhead expenses.the efficiency ratio, calculated by dividing

2015.total assets increased by $67.1 million or 3.4% from december31, 2014.the increase in assets was primarily associated with a $111.9 million or 7.9% increase in gross loans, a $33.4 million or

banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.cash and cash equivalents are used for daily cash management purposes, management of short-term interest rate opportunities, and liquidity.cash and cash equivalents as of march31, 2015 were $99.4 million compared to $103.6 million at december31, 2014 and consisted mainly of deposits with frb.in the future, the company expects to utilize its cash on hand to support loan origination activity.investment securities.  our investment portfolio at march31, 2015 consisted primarily of u.s. agency, mortgage-backed securities (‚Äúmbs‚Äù), and asset-backed securities ("abs").  repayment of principal and interest of the abs is dependent upon the performance of the underlying loan collateral.  the company performs due diligence of each security on a pre- and post-purchase basis to evaluate the underlying collateral and invests in the investment grade tranches of securitizations.  however, should defaults or loss severities exceed the credit enhancement in the structure, payment of principal or interest may be impacted.   the company currently does not own any collateralized loan obligation securities that are not compliant with the volcker rule.our available for sale securities are reported at fair value and are used primarily for liquidity, pledging, earnings, and asset / liability management purposes and are reviewed quarterly for possible impairment.due to portfolio activity, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities at march 31, 2015 decreased $67.7 million or 2.4% to $234.5 million compared to $302.2 million at december 31, 2014.  the proceeds from investment security sales partially funded the loan portfolio growth.loans.  as a holding company of two community banks, we have a primary objective of meeting the business and consumer credit needs within our markets where standards of profitability, client relationships, and credit quality intersect.  our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment loans.  lending decisions are based upon evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the 40table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditionquality and value of the collateral securing the loan.  personal guarantees are required on most loans; however, prudent exceptions are made on occasion based upon the financial viability of the borrowing entity or the underlying project that is being financed.gross loans increased by $111.9 million or 7.9% during the three months ended march 31, 2015. this growth was primarily driven by a $104.8 million marine loan portfolio purchase, arranged by the shore premier finance marine lending unit, of which $75.3 million were installment loans and $29.4 million were commercial loans. credit concentrations are measured against internal and prudential regulatory guidelines.  additionally, our prudent business practices and internal guidelines and underwriting standards will continue to be followed in making lending decisions in order to manage exposure to credit-related losses.allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.  the allowance for loan losses was $28.2 million or 1.84% of outstanding loans as of march 31, 2015 compared with $27.1 million or 1.90% of outstanding loans as of december31, 2014.the allowance for loan losses increased $1.1 million during the three months ended march 31, 2015 as a result of recoveries exceeding charge-offs, and additional provisions for loan losses.  our provision for loan losses was $600 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2015, compared to $100 thousand recorded for the same period in 2014. we did not make any significant changes to our methodology or model for estimating the allowance for loan losses during this most recent quarter or during any of the past three years.the allowance consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. table 4 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and other related information at march31, 2015 and december 31, 2014.table 4:allowance for loan

determined to be impaired and, therefore, are individually evaluated for impairment.the specific component increased during the three months ended march 31, 2015, primarily due to a modest rise in non-performing and impaired loans.impaired loans increased to $49.6 million at march31, 2015 from $48.9 million at december31, 2014.of these loans, $22.9 million were on nonaccrual status at march 31, 2015 as compared with $21.5 million at december31, 2014, an increase of 13.5%.  the general or pooled component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and collectively evaluated for impairment.  the combination of a longer historical loss look-back period, lengthening loss emergence periods in certain loan categories, and substantial loan portfolio growth necessitated an increase in general reserves.  strong net recoveries helped to build the total reserve by offsetting some provisioning that would have been necessary otherwise.  a loan loss provision of $600 thousand was added to the total reserve during the quarter.  an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses.  the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance decreased due to a combination of factors.  macroeconomic indicators, particularly gdp measures, indicated a sharp reduction in economic growth.  however, we did not see evidence of this contraction in the markets we serve; therefore, we limited the growth in the unallocated component that considers external variables.   the portion of the unallocated component that considers internal variables declined as a reflection of management‚Äôs assessment of the improved health of the portfolio and the assessed quality of the company's credit processes. 41table of contentshampton roads bankshares, incpart i.  financial informationitem2 - management‚Äôs discussion and analysisof results of operations and financial conditiontable 5

for which an allowance has been provided20.5417.88at march31, 2015, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses to be commensurate with the risk existing in our portfolio.  however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations. non-performing assets.  management classifies non-performing assets as those loans on which payments have been delinquent 90 days and are still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, and other real estate and repossessed assets.total non-performing assets were $40.8 million and $43.2 million at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.  our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of non-performing assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 2.54% and 2.95% at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.  at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014 there were no loans categorized as 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.loans in nonaccrual status totaled $22.9 million and $21.5 million at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.  loans are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, part of the balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans  reach 90 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless there are extenuating circumstances.  we had $17.9 million and $21.7 million of other real estate owned and repossessed assets at march 31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.this decline was mainly due to sales of real estate owned outpacing foreclosure and repossession activity during the quarter. the company‚Äôs largest borrower, as measured by total exposure, was downgraded to substandard in the third quarter of 2014.  there is the potential for non-performing assets to materially increase should this borrower‚Äôs ability to repay become negatively affected.   deposits.  deposits increased $102.1 million or 6.5% from december31, 2014, as a result of increases of $53.1 million or 18.0% in time deposits over $100 thousand, increases of $25.1 million or 9.4% in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, increases of $12.0 million or 1.9% in interest-bearing demand deposits, increases of $8.3 million or 2.4% in time deposits less than $100 thousand, and increases of $3.6 million or 6.4% in savings deposits.  the company has made a concerted effort to attract additional deposits in order to support planned and anticipated loan growth.  approximately half of the deposit growth came from the addition of one commercial deposit relationship obtained through the company's expansion into baltimore, md.borrowings.  we use short-term and long-term borrowings from various sources including the frb discount window, fhlb, and trust preferred securities.we manage the level of our borrowings to ensure that we have adequate sources of liquidity.refer to our 2014 form 10-k for further discussion about our borrowings.liquidity.  liquidity represents an institution‚Äôs ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management.it is used by management to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds.we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during the three months ended march 31, 2015.  at march31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $99.4 million, and investment securities available for sale, at fair value were $234.5 million.42table of

lines in the amount of $237.9 million at the fhlb with advances of $125.7 million utilized.these lines may be utilized for short- and/or long-term borrowing.at march 31, 2015, all our fhlb borrowings mature by september 2015.we also possess additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements.the banks also maintain federal funds lines with three regional banking institutions and through the frb discount window.these available lines totaled approximately $92.7 million at march31, 2015, and none of these lines were utilized for borrowing purposes at march 31, 2015.capital resources.  total shareholders‚Äô equity increased $4.1 million or 7.4% to $201.6 million at march 31, 2015, from $197.5 million at december 31, 2014.  the company and the banks are subject to regulatory capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures to ensure capital adequacy.tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders‚Äô equity before non-controlling interest, plus qualified trust preferred securities, plus net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, less intangible assets.  total risk-based capital adds qualifying allowances for loan losses.common equity tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders‚Äô equity before non-controlling interest, less intangible assets.as of march31, 2015, our consolidated regulatory capital ratios were tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.02%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.88%, total risk-based capital ratio of 14.13%, and common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.29%.as of march31, 2015, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums, and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the banks' tier 1 leverage ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and common equity tier 1 capital ratio were as follows: 10.23%, 11.69%, 12.94, and 11.69%, respectively for bohr and 9.99%, 13.16%, 14.24%, and 13.16%, respectively for shore.contractual obligations.  we have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements.additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties.our contractual obligations consist of time deposits, borrowings, and operating lease obligations.off-balance sheet arrangements.  we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet our customers‚Äô financing needs.for more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to note 13, financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk,

riskinterest rate sensitivitymarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the company.fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company‚Äôs interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.the primary goal of our asset/liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment.our ability to manage our interest rate risk depends generally on our ability to match the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income.our management, guided by alco, determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.these decisions are based on management‚Äôs expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.the primary method that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets and liabilities over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures.this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon.key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments.the table below illustrates the expected effect on net interest income for the twelve months following march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 due to an immediate change in interest rates.estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions, such as those previously discussed.effect on net interest incomemarch 31, 2015december 31, 2014change in net interest

income in a decreasing interest rate environment.as of december31, 2014, we projected an increase in net interest income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment.it should be noted, however, that the simulation analysis is based upon equivalent changes in interest rates for all categories of assets and liabilities.in normal operating conditions, interest rate changes rarely occur in such a uniform manner.many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments.in addition, management may deploy strategies that offset some of the impact of changes in interest rates.dependent upon timing and shifts in the interest rate term structure, certain rising rate scenarios are less favorable due to lower levels of assets with short-term re-pricing characteristics, as well as due to the variable rate structure on the majority of our borrowings and the floors on many loans that will cause a delay in any interest income improvement. consequently, variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis.management utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over varying time horizons. the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a flat-rate case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest. these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet mix, pricing and the re-pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet.45table of

participation of the company‚Äôs management, including the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act) as of march 31, 2015.based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as of march 31, 2015 were effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported by management of the company on a timely basis in order to comply with the company‚Äôs disclosure obligations under the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.changes in internal control over financial reporting. no change in the company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act) occurred during the three months ended march 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.46table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii - other informationitem 1 - legal proceedingsin the ordinary course of operations, the company may become a party to legal proceedings.based upon information currently available, management believes that such legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations except as provided below.on november 21, 2014, in the matter of scott c. harvard v. shore bank et al (cl13-4525-00), the circuit court for the city of norfolk, virginia ruled that former shore bank president scott c. harvard was entitled to $655,495.43 in severance pay, plus interest from may 20, 2014, and $155,000.00 in attorney‚Äôs fees, plus additional fees incurred since july 15, 2014. mr. harvard had initiated the claim in june 2013 alleging that the company and shore bank were contractually obligated to make certain severance payments to him following the termination of his employment in 2009.  the company asserts that mr. harvard was not entitled to a ‚Äúgolden parachute‚Äù severance due to application of a regulation under the tarp program and furthermore, that based upon the legally distinct entity from which harvard derived his compensation, shore bank did not owe harvard severance compensation. the judge ruled in favor of harvard that the prohibition of the payment of his contracted severance compensation was a taking of his private property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment to the constitution, and further that the company was prohibited from making the argument, based upon the doctrine of judicial estoppel, that shore bank was legally distinct from the holding company that employed mr. harvard. the company filed a petition for appeal on february 27, 2015 in the supreme court of virginia.item 1a ‚Äì risk factorsfor information regarding factors that could affect the company's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in

financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-q.accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements.in the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation.the results of operations for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.the company has two banking subsidiaries, bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù, collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù), which constitute substantially all of the company‚Äôs assets and operations. for further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the company‚Äôs annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013 (‚Äú2013 form 10-k‚Äù). use of estimates in the preparation of financial statementsthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) requires management to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.actual results could differ from those estimates. material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, determination of fair value for financial instruments, and tax assets, liabilities, and expenses.recent accounting pronouncementsduring the second quarter of 2014, asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (‚Äúnew revenue standard‚Äù), was issued. asu 2014-09 represents a comprehensive reform of many of the revenue recognition requirements in gaap. the asu creates a new topic within the accounting standards codification (‚Äúasc‚Äù), topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. the new revenue standard will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and supersedes or amends much of the industry-specific revenue recognition guidance found throughout the asc.the core principle of the new revenue standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. the asu creates a five-step process for achieving that core principle: (1) identifying the contract with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue when an entity has completed the performance obligations. the asu also requires additional disclosures that allow users of the financial statements to understand the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows resulting from contracts with customers. the guidance in the asu is effective for the company on january 1, 2017. the new revenue standard permits the use of retrospective or cumulative effect transition methods. it appears that substantially all of the company‚Äôs contracts with customers (i.e., financial instruments) do not fall within the scope of the new revenue standard; however, the company is in the process of determining whether the asu will have a material impact on the company‚Äôs reported financial results and, if necessary, selecting a transition method.in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables ‚Äì troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon a foreclosure, which clarifies when banks and similar institutions (creditors) should reclassify mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties from the loan portfolio to other real estate owned (oreo). the asu defines when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure has occurred and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. this asu allows for prospective or modified retrospective application. the effective date for public business entities is for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted.the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.in august 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update (‚Äúasu‚Äù) 2014-14, receivables - troubled debt restructuring by creditors (subtopic 310-40): classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans  8table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsupon foreclosure, which will require creditors to derecognize certain foreclosed government-guaranteed mortgage loans and to recognize a separate other receivable that is measured at the amount the creditor expects to recover from the guarantor, and to treat the guarantee and the receivable as a single unit of account. asu 2014-14 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. an entity can elect a prospective or a modified retrospective transition method, but must use the same transition method that it elected under fasb asu no. 2014-04, reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. early adoption, including adoption in an interim period, is permitted if the entity already adopted asu 2014-04.the company has not yet determined whether the asu will have a material impact on the company‚Äôs reported financial results.in july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, income taxes, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented, with some exceptions, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.this update is effective for years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15, 2013.early adoption is permitted.the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.note b - regulatory matters effective june 9, 2010, the company and its banking subsidiary, bohr, entered into a written agreement (herein called the ‚Äúwritten agreement‚Äù) with the federal reserve bank of richmond (‚Äúfrb‚Äù) and the bureau of financial institutions of the virginia state corporation commission (‚Äúbureau of financial institutions‚Äù or ‚Äùbfi‚Äù).the written agreement was terminated on february 20, 2014 and the company and bohr are no longer subject to its terms and conditions.shore was not subject to the written agreement.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into a memorandum of understanding (the ‚Äúmou‚Äù) with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before, (i) either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind; (ii) the company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; (iii) the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or (iv) the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.on april 14, 2014, the united states department of the treasury (‚Äútreasury‚Äù) sold its common stock, which it acquired through the company‚Äôs participation in the capital purchase program (‚Äúcpp‚Äù) of the treasury‚Äôs troubled asset relief program (‚Äútarp‚Äù). as a result of participation in tarp, our executives and certain of our employees were subject to compensation related limitations and restrictions, which applied so long as the treasury held the common stock it received in return for the financial assistance it provided us (disregarding any warrants to purchase our common stock that the treasury may hold). therefore, the compensation related limitations and restrictions will not apply to compensation earned after the treasury‚Äôs sale.in connection with the treasury‚Äôs sale, the company agreed to cancel certain restricted stock units that became non-payable under the treasury‚Äôs tarp regulations at the time of sale. 9table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsnote c - earnings per sharethe following table shows the basic and

securities, six mortgage-backed non-agency securities, and thirteen asset-backed securities. the severity and duration of unrealized losses is expected to fluctuate with market interest rates. at september 30, 2014, one equity security experienced an unrealized loss totaling $9 thousand. there were no unrealized losses in equity securities at december 31, 2013.other-than-temporary impairment (‚Äúotti‚Äù)during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, no securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and no impairment losses were recognized through noninterest income.management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.in determining otti, management considers many factors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.the assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 12table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementswhen otti occurs, the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss.if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss, the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment‚Äôs amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.maturities of investment securitiesthe amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity of investment securities available for sale that are not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013are shown below.

default and subsequent movement to nonaccrual status, that were modified as tdr‚Äôs within the previous twelve months.loans that are considered tdrs are considered specifically impaired and the primary consideration for measurement of impairment is the present value of the expected cash flows.however, given the prevalence of real estate secured loans in the company‚Äôs portfolio of troubled assets, the majority of the company‚Äôs tdr loans are ultimately considered collateral-dependent.as a practical expedient, impairments are, therefore, calculated based  24table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsupon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.observable market prices for the sale of the respective notes are not considered as a basis for impairment for any of the company‚Äôs impaired loans.in determining the estimated fair valueof collateral dependent impaired loans, the company uses third party appraisals and, if necessary, utilizes a proprietary database of its own historical property appraisals in conjunction with external data and applies a relevant discount derived from analysis of appraisals of similar property type, vintage, and geographic location (for example, in situations where the most recent available appraisal is aged and an updated appraisal has not yet been received).the company does not participate in any government or company sponsored tdr programs and holds no corresponding assets.rather, loans are individually modified in situations where the company believes it will minimize the probability of losses to the company.additionally, the company had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing receivables whose terms have been modified in tdrs at september 30, 2014.note f - other real estate owned and repossessed assetsthe following table shows a rollforward of other real estate owned and repossessed assets for the nine

-$4,477$741$1,577$(3,270)note i - derivative instrumentsderivatives are a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying assets.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.in connection with the underwriting process, the company enters into commitments to lock-in the interest rate of the loan with the borrower prior to funding (‚Äúinterest rate lock commitments‚Äù).generally, such interest rate lock commitments are for periods less than 60 days.these interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives.the company manages its exposure to changes in fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments by entering into simultaneous agreements to sell the residential loans to third party investors shortly after their origination and funding.at september 30, 2014 and at december 31, 2013 the company had loans held for sale of $25.8 million and $25.1 million, respectively. 29table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsunder the contractual relationship in the best efforts method, the company is obligated to sell the loans only if the loans close. as a result of the terms of these contractual relationships, the company is not exposed tochanges in fair value nor will it realize gains related to its interest rate lock commitments due to subsequent changes in interest rates.at september 30, 2014 and at december 31, 2013, the company had rate-lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans (unfunded par amount of loans) on a best efforts basis in the amounts of $49.6 million and $35.6 million, respectively. from september 2012to december 2013, the company sold some of its mortgage loan production on a mandatory delivery basis and using derivative instruments (essentially forward delivery commitments and to-be-announced securities) to manage the resulting interest rate risk.these derivatives were entered into as balance sheet risk management instruments, and therefore, were not designated as an accounting hedge.under the mandatory delivery approach, residential mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates exposed the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment until the loans are delivered to the investor.also, the decrease in the carrying value of the underlying loans and interest rate lock commitments totaled $247 thousand during that same period. gains and losses on the company‚Äôs derivative instruments are included within mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.additionally, to meet the needs of its commercial customers, the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.derivative contracts are executed between the company and certain commercial loan customers with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program enabling the commercial loan customers to effectively exchange variable-rate interest payments under their existing obligations for fixed-rate interest payments.for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, the company recorded gains totaling $227 thousand and $514 thousand, respectively, related to trading income on the interest rate swaps included in the back-to-back swap program that was included within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.as of september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the company has derivative financial instruments not included in hedge relationships.these derivatives consist of interest rate swaps to facilitate interest rate management strategies for both the company and its commercial borrowers.certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet and/or subject to master netting arrangements.the company‚Äôs derivative transactions with financial institution counterparties are generally executed under international swaps and derivative association (‚Äúisda‚Äù) master agreements which include ‚Äúright of setoff‚Äù provisions.in such cases there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and there may be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis.nonetheless, the company does not generally offset financial instruments for financial reporting purposes.

-986156 -830note j - fair value measurementsfair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.the company classifies financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.valuation methodologies for the fair value hierarchy are as follows.level 1 ‚Äì quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.level 2 ‚Äì observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose values are determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. level 3 ‚Äì unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.level 3 assets and liabilities include values that are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. the categorization of an asset or liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.recurring basisthe company measures or monitors certain of its assets on a fair value basis.fair value is used on a recurring basis for those assets and liabilities for which an election was made as well as for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting.the following tables reflect the fair value of assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at september 30,

that caused the transfer. the following describes the valuation techniques used to estimate fair value for our assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis.investment securities available for sale.where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products, and exchange traded equities.if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.level 2 securities would include u.s. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed, and other securities valued using third party quoted prices in markets that are not active.in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. derivative loan commitments.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.under the best efforts basis, the company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate is fixed prior to funding.these commitments, in which the company intends to sell in the secondary market, are considered freestanding derivatives.under the mandatory delivery basis, mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates expose the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment.the fair values of interest rate lock and mandatory delivery commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as level 3, are based on quoted prices adjusted for commitments that the company does not expect to fund.interest rate swaps. the company uses observable inputs to determine fair value of its interest rate swaps.the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques that are based on discounted cash flow analysis using the expected cash flows of each derivative over the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and market-based interest rate curves.the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments.the variable cash payments were based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.accordingly, the company categorizes these financial instruments within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 33table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsnonrecurring basiscertain assets, specifically collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment and an allowance is established to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value).the adjustments are based on appraisals of underlying collateral or other observable market prices when current appraisals or observable market prices are available.where we do not have an appraisal that is less than 12 months old, an existing appraisal or other valuation would be utilized after discounting it to reflect current market conditions, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. to assist in the discounting process, a valuation matrix was developed to provide valuation guidance for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned where it was deemed that an existing appraisal was outdated as to current market conditions.the matrix applies discounts to external appraisals depending on the type of real estate and age of the appraisal.the discounts are generally specific point estimates; however in some cases, the matrix allows for a small range of values.the discounts were based in part upon externally derived statistical data.the discounts were also based upon management‚Äôs knowledge of market conditions and prices of sales of other real estate owned. in addition, matrix value adjustments may be made by our independent appraisal group to reflect property value trends within specific markets as well as actual sales data from market transactions and/or foreclosed real estate sales.it is the company‚Äôs policy to classify these as level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy.the weighted average age of appraisals for valuations of collateral dependent impaired loans was 0.62 years as of september 30, 2014 and 0.73 years as of december 31, 2013.management periodically reviews the discounts in the matrix as compared to valuations from updated appraisals and modifies the discounts accordingly should updated appraisals reflect valuations significantly different than those derived utilizing the matrix.to date, management believes the appraisal discount matrix has resulted in appropriate adjustments to existing appraisals thereby providing management with reasonable valuations for the collateral underlying the loan portfolio; however, while appraisals are indicators of fair value, the amount realized upon sale of these assets could be significantly different. the following tables reflect the fair value of assets measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013. assetsfair value measurements atmeasured atseptember 30, 2014 using(in thousands)fair valuelevel 1level 2level 3impaired loans$42,716$ -$ -$42,716other real estate

contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsimpaired loans.the majority of the company‚Äôs impaired loans are considered collateral dependent. for collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.  due to the nature of real-estate appraisals and the discounts applied by the company in determining fair value of the underlying collateral as described previously, collateral-dependent loans are considered level 3 financial instruments.other real estate owned and repossessed assets.the adjustments to other real estate owned and repossessed assets are based primarily on appraisals of the real estate or other observable market prices.our policy is that fair values for these assets are based on current appraisals.in most cases, we maintain current appraisals for these items.where we do not have a current appraisal, an existing appraisal would be utilized after discounting it to reflect changes in market conditions from the date of the existing appraisal, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. branch consolidation. on march 27, 2013, the company announced the consolidation of seven bohr and shore branch locations, six owned and one leased, into nearby branches.this required an impairment analysis to be performed.in connection with the analysis, five of the branch locations were determined to have carrying amounts that exceeded fair value at march 31, 2013.accordingly, the related carrying amounts of these branches were reduced to estimated fair value (less costs to sell) and the company recorded an impairment totaling $2.8 million during the quarter ended march 31, 2013.management estimated the fair value of the branches by utilizing various market-based valuation techniques, including estimates from unrelated brokers, existing purchase offers from unrelated parties, and appraisals available as of the measurement date.approximately $3.4 million related to the remaining carrying values of the branch related assets was transferred into other real estate owned in accordance with relevant accounting guidance and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.significant unobservable inputsthe following table presents the ranges of

measurementsadditionally, accounting standards require the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value. for the financial instruments that the company does not record at fair value, estimates of fair value are made at a point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument.no readily available market exists for a significant portion of the company‚Äôs financial instruments.fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, interest rate risk characteristics, and other factors. many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by  35table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementscomparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument.in addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates.the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating fair value of these financial instruments. (a) cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(b)investment securities available for salefair values are based on published market prices where available. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow.investment securities available for sale are carried at their aggregate fair value. (c)restricted equity securitiesthese investments are carried at costas there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb, frb, or member institutions.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(d)loans held for salethe carrying value of loans held for sale is a reasonable estimate of fair value since loans held for sale are expected to be sold within a short period. (e)loansto determine the fair values of loans other than those listed as nonaccrual, we use discounted cash flow analyses.in these analyses, we use discount rates that are similar to the interest rates and terms currently being offered to borrowers of similar terms and credit quality.for nonaccrual loans, we use a variety of techniques to measure fair value, such as using the current appraised value of the collateral, discounting the contractual cash flows, and analyzing market data that we may adjust due to the specific characteristics of the loan or collateral.(f)interest receivable and interest payablethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(g)bank-owned life insurancethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(h)depositsthe fair values disclosed for transaction deposits such as demand and savings accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (this is, their carrying values).the carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date.fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on comparable instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.(i)borrowingsthe fair value of borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.these include fhlb borrowings and other borrowings. (j)commitments to extend credit and standby letters of creditthe only amounts recorded for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are the deferred fees arising from these unrecognized financial instruments.these deferred fees are not deemed significant at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and as such, the related fair values have not been estimated. 36table of

success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members;we are not paying dividends on our common stock and currently are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;we had previously elected to defer payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company.however, we received approval from the frb and bfi under the mou to pay all previously deferred interest payments and have done so.while all deferred payments have been made, our outstanding trust preferred securities permit future deferrals and under the mou,future payments to service the trust preferred securities interest remain subject to regulatory approval;we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels;our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations;the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements;economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition;virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock; our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations;our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry; sales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price;the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss;if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;we have had large numbers of problem loans relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so;the determination of the appropriate balance of our

policiesu.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex assumptions, judgments, and estimates.our assumptions, judgments, and estimates may be incorrect, and changes in such assumptions, judgments, and estimates may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.actual results, in fact, could differ materially from those estimates.we consider our policies on allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred taxes, and the valuation of other real estate owned to be critical accounting policies.refer to our 2013 form 10-k for further discussion of these policies.material trends and uncertaintiesgeneral economic conditions in our major markets remained uneven for the nine months ended september 30, 2014. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the hampton roads region‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in august 2014, compared to 5.3% in december 2013.our region has experienced declines in employment this year mainly due to defense cuts in federal government civilian jobs.with nearly half of the hampton roads local economy driven by the military spending, any cuts in federal spending have a direct impact on the economic growth rate.although the company‚Äôs overall loan growth is down $3.6 million or 0.3% during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013, the third quarter produced a 1.3% growth over the second quarter.it still appears that the federal reserve‚Äôs intention is to continue to maintain a low interest rate environment at least into 2015. we expect the current low interest rate environment to continue to place downward pressure on our net interest income and our overall operating net income.due to the continued improvement in the overall credit quality of our portfolio, non-performing assets have declined 33.4% since december 31, 2013, reducing the drag on income related to these problem assets. the elevation of mortgage interest rates which began in late summer 2013, has caused a dramatic decline in refinancing activityand will continue to put downward pressure on overall  39table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionmortgage banking revenue. refinancing activity accounted for 30% of mortgage originations during the first nine months of 2014, as compared to 51% for the same period in 2013.due to cost reduction initiatives implemented over the last few years, noninterest expense has declined, thus improving our overall efficiency.for further discussion of the material trends and uncertainties that may affect our results and financial condition, refer to the risk factors contained part ii item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù in this report.company overviewhampton roads bankshares, inc. (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in virginia beach, virginia.the company‚Äôs primary subsidiaries are bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù).the banks engage in general community and commercial banking business, targeting the needs of individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in our primary service areas.currently, bohr operates 17 full-service offices in the hampton roads region of southeastern virginia and 10 full-service offices throughout richmond, virginia and the northeastern and research triangle regions of north carolina that do business as gateway bank & trust co. (‚Äúgateway‚Äù).shore operates 7 full-service offices in the eastern shore of virginia and maryland and 3 loan production offices in maryland and delaware.through various divisions, the banks also offer mortgage banking and marine financing.our largest investor shareholders include anchorage capital group, l.l.c. (‚Äúanchorage‚Äù), capgen capital group vi lp (‚Äúcapgen‚Äù), and the carlyle group, l.p. (‚Äúcarlyle‚Äù).anchorage, capgen, and carlyle own 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of september 30, 2014. our primary source of revenue is net interest income earned by our bank subsidiaries.net interest income represents interest and fees earned from lending and investment activities less the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.net interest income may be impacted by variations in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the yields earned and the rates paid, level of non-performing assets, and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support earning assets.in addition to net interest income, noninterest income is another important source of revenue.noninterest income is derived primarily from service charges on deposits and mortgage banking revenue.gains and losses on the sale or impairment of our other real estate owned and repossessed assets are recognized in noninterest income.other significant factors that impact net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. are the provision for loan losses, and noninterest expense.the direct lending activities in which the company engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. as such, interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve") and general economic conditions, nationally and in the company's primary market areas, have a significant impact on the company's results of operations. to the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the company in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the company. regarding net interest margin, the company makes fixed rate loans, whereby general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce the company's spread as the interest rates the company must pay for deposits may increase while interest income may be unchanged. economic conditions may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans and the ability to liquidate that property to satisfy a loan if necessary.the company's goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures and modifying those policies on occasion to account for changing or emerging risks or changing market conditions, evaluating each borrower's business plan and financial condition during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and maintaining sufficient collateral to mitigate economic loss in the event of liquidation. an allowance for loan losses has been established which consists of general, specific, and unallocated components. a risk rating system is employed to estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general reserve allocations.the general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for specific impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated for potential loss.the specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment.the specific allowance for loan losses is based on a loan-by-loan analysis and varies between impaired loans largely due to the value of the loan‚Äôs underlying collateral.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses and considers internal portfolio management effectiveness and external macroeconomic factors. 40table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionoverview of results of operations and financial conditionthe following commentary provides information about the major components of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources.this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan defaults and net charge-offs that we experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.the company reported net income for the nine months ended september 30, 2014, as it did for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to the net operating losses from 2009 to 2012.this improvement in net income primarily resulted from improved general economic conditions and credit performance of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio. there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which increased in 2013, resulting in significantly lower revenue in our mortgage segment. the company also recognized $3.8 million in income from bank-owned life insurance for the nine months ended september 30, 2014, which is significantly higher than the company‚Äôs historic average of bank-owned life insurance income.as of september 30, 2014, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the following is a summary of our financial condition as of september 30, 2014 and our financial performance for the three and nine months then ended.assets were $2.0 billion at september 30, 2014.total assets increased by $66.9 million or 3.4% from december 31, 2013.the increase in assets was primarily associated with a $59.6 million or 139.0% increase in overnight funds sold and due from frb, a $26.6 million or 8.2% increase in investment securities available for sale, a$6.3 million or 18.0% decrease in the allowance for loan losses, a $726 thousand or 2.9% increase in loans held for sale, partially offset by a $3.6 million or 0.3% decrease in gross loans, and a $13.9 million or 37.9% decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed assets.investment securities available for sale increased $26.6 million or 8.2% to $352.1 million as of september 30, 2014 from $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.the increase primarily resulted from the purchase of additional securities which was partially offset by a decline in the unrealized gain of the portfolio.gross loans decreased by $3.6 million or 0.3% during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, primarily due to normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume.impaired loans decreased by $14.1 million during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 to $53.5 million at september 30, 2014, down from $67.6 million at december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a downward trend in non-accrual commercial construction loans.allowance for loan losses at september 30, 2014 decreased 18.0% to $28.7 million from $35.0 million at december 31, 2013 as net charge-offs of previously identified impaired loans exceeded additional provisions for loan losses. in particular, the specific component of the allowance for loan losses decreased to $5.5 million from $13.1 million.deposits at september 30, 2014 increased $89.3 million or 5.9% from december 31, 2013 as a result of increases of $38.2 million or 15.5% in non-interest bearing demand deposits, increases of $16.8 million or 5.2% in time deposits less than $100 thousand, increases of $5.6 million or 1.9% in time deposits over $100 thousand, increases of $33.5 million or 5.6% in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by decreases of $4.7 million or 7.5% in savings deposits. seasonal inflows contributed to the 3.3% increase in deposits during the three months ended september 30, 2014. 41table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionnet income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 was $2.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, as compared with net income for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2013 of $2.8 millionand $3.5 million, respectively.net interest income decreased $628 thousand and $2.7 million in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013. the decrease for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 was due primarily to the decrease in average interest-earning assets, and a decline in net interest margin, whereas the decrease for the three months ended september 30, 2014 was due primarily to a decline in net interest margin.the continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio quality resulted in a modest loan loss provision of $16 thousand needed during the three months ended september 30, 2014, bringing the total loan loss provision for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 to $116 thousand.noninterest income for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 was $6.1 million and $19.0 million, respectively, a decline of 22.4% and 9.4%from the same periods in 2013.  a major driver of this decline is mortgage banking revenue which had flat growth for the three months ended september 30, 2014 and decreased $5.2 million or 38.8% during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.the decrease in mortgage banking revenue is due to declines in both origination volume and margin, driven by rising market interest rates, which resulted ina dramatic negative impact on refinance demand. offsetting these declines were decreases in losses on premises and equipment associated with certain branch closings in 2013, and decreases in other than temporary impairment of other real estate owned and repossessed assets. for the nine months ended september 30, 2014, income from bank-owned life insurance increased $806 thousand or 26.7%, compared to the same period in 2013, mainly due to life insurance benefits received in excess of cash surrender value from the deaths of two former employees. income from bank-owned life insurance declined $1.8 million, or 87.4%, during the three months ended september 30, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, mainly due to timing and amounts of life insurance benefits received in excess of cash surrender value..noninterest expense was $19.1 million and $55.4 million, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014, respectively, representing declines of$1.6 million or 7.9% and $7.0 million or 11.3%, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to lower salary and employee benefits, occupancy, and fdic insurance expenses.our effective tax rate was 0.0% for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared to 2.9% for the same period in 2013.these rates differ from the statutory rate due primarily to the valuation allowance against the company‚Äôs deferred tax assets.refer to our 2013 form 10-k for additional information relating to deferred tax assets.analysis of results of operationsnet income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 was $2.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, as compared with net income for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2013 of $2.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively.net interest income and net interest marginnet interest income, a major component of our earnings, is the difference between the income generated by interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.net interest margin, which is calculated by expressing annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, is an indicator of effectiveness in generating income from earning assets. net interest income and net interest margin may be significantly impacted by the market interest rates (rate); the mix, duration, and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume); changes in the yields earned and rates paid; and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support interest-earning assets.our management team strives to maximize net interest income through prudent balance sheet administration and by maintaining appropriate risk levels as determined by our asset / liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù) and the board of directors.  42table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations

conditioninterest-earning assets consist of loans, investment and restricted equity securities, overnight funds sold and due from frb, and interest-bearing deposits in other banks and interest-bearing liabilities consist of deposit accounts and borrowings. net interest income for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 was $15.2 million and $45.2 million, respectively, a decrease of $628 thousand or 4.0% and $2.7 million or 5.6%, as compared to the same periods in 2013. net interest margin for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014 was 3.24% and 3.32%, respectively, down from 3.42% and 3.44%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2013.in the current low interest rate environment, the company expects to continue to experience downward pressure on net interest margin, as rates on interest earning assets decline at a faster pace than that of our interest-bearing liabilities.interest income on loans, including fees, decreased predominantly as the result of a decline in the average yield on loans and a decline in average loan balances during the nine months ended september 30, 2014.interest income on investment securities increased due to higher reinvestment rates, slower prepayment speeds, security allocation, and an increase in the overall size of the investment portfolio.interest income on overnight funds sold and due from frb decreased modestly.  the decrease in interest expense on deposits for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 resulted from a decline in average interest-bearing deposits and an overall decrease in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits. however, interest expense on deposits has increased for the three months ended september 30, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, due to growth in average interest-bearing deposits and an overall increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.  interest expense on borrowings, which consisted of fhlb borrowings and other borrowings, decreased mainly due to maturing fhlb advances being paid down, as well as the overall lower average interest rate paid on borrowings.in 2011, following a review of the company‚Äôs current level of assumed interest rate risk and to promote liquidity and enhance current earnings, the company modified certain advances with the fhlb. a majority of the company‚Äôs existing fixed-rate advances were restructured as floating rate obligations at a fixed spread to three month libor with maturities ranging from 2.75 to 4 years. noninterest incomefor the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014, total noninterest income was $6.1 million and $19.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.8 million or 22.4% and $2.0 million or 9.4%, compared to the same periods in 2013. we define total revenue as the sum of interest income and non-interest income. noninterest income comprised 25.1% and 25.9% of total revenue during the three and

to the opening of two loan production offices and increased share-based compensation. occupancy expense declined due to lower depreciation and rental expenses, as we have reduced the number of physical locations of our bank subsidiaries.fdic insurance expense has declined as our assessment rates have decreased due to the company‚Äôs improved risk profile. problem loan and repossessed asset costs declined due to the overall decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed assets. directors‚Äô and regional board fees increased mainly due to the election of additional directors to the company‚Äôs board as well as an overall increase in individual board member compensation. other noninterest expense declined due to decreased atm network fees driven by lower customer usage of atm‚Äôs

informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionanalysis of financial conditionassets were $2.0 billion at september 30, 2014.total assets increased by $66.9 million or 3.4% from december 31, 2013.the increase in assets was primarily associated with a $59.6 million or 139.0% increase in overnight funds sold and due from frb, a $26.6 million or 8.2% increase in investment securities available for sale, a $6.3 million or 18.0% decrease in the allowance for loan losses, a $726thousand or 2.9% increase in loans held for sale, partially offset by a $3.6 million or 0.3% decrease in gross loans, and a $13.9 million or 37.9% decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed assets.cash and cash equivalents.cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.cash and cash equivalents are used for daily cash management purposes, management of short-term interest rate opportunities, and liquidity.cash and cash equivalents as of september 30, 2014 were $120.1 million compared to $62.3 million at december 31, 2013 and consisted mainly of deposits with frb.primarily due to normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume, and seasonal inflows of deposits, the company experienced an increase in the overall level of cash and cash equivalents.in the future, the company expects to utilize its cash on hand to support future loan origination activity.investment securities. our investment portfolio at september 30, 2014 consisted primarily of u.s. agency, mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities.the allocation to asset-backed securities, which began in 2013, provides the company with a floating rate asset, which mitigates the interest rate risk inherent in certain other asset classes, e.g., mortgage backed securities (‚Äúmbs‚Äù).repayment of principal and interest of the abs security is dependent upon the performance of the underlying loan collateral.the company performs due diligence of each security on a pre- and post-purchase basis to evaluate the underlying collateral and invests in the investment grade tranches of securitizations.however, should defaults or loss severities exceed the credit enhancement in the structure, payment of principal or interest may be impacted.   the company currently does not own any collateralized loan obligation securities that are not compliant with the volcker rule.our available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value and are used primarily for liquidity, pledging, earnings, and asset/liability management purposes and are reviewed quarterly for possible impairment. due to portfolio activity, the fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities at september 30, 2014 increased $26.6 million or 8.2% to $352.1 million compared to $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.loans. as a holding company of two community banks, we have a primary objective of meeting the business and consumer credit needs within our markets where standards of profitability, client relationships, and credit quality intersect.our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment loans.lending decisions are based upon evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan.personal guarantees are required on most loans; however, prudent exceptions are made on occasion based upon the financial viability of the borrowing entity or the underlying project that is being financed.overall our loan trends during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 have been influenced by continued soft demand for loans in nearly all our loan categories.our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased $19.6 million to the september 30, 2014 balance of $205.9 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $225.5 million.construction loans decreased $27.0 million to the september 30, 2014 balance of $131.5 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $158.5 million.our real estate-commercial mortgage loan portfolio increased $44.8 million to the september 30, 2014 balance of $635.3 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $590.5 million. the company has experienced greater demand for commercial real estate related credit relative to other loan types.credit concentrations are measured against internal and prudential regulatory guidelines.the real estate-residential mortgage loan portfolio showed a modest decrease to $347.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $354.0 million. the installment loan portfolio increased $4.6 million to the september 30, 2014 balance of $62.2 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $57.6 million.in addition to the aforementioned modest demand for credit, the contraction seen in loans stems from the continued resolution of problem loans.origination volumes were also offset by principal pay-downs and scheduled amortization in the portfolio.additionally, our prudent business practices and internal guidelines and underwriting standards will continue to be followed in making lending decisions in order to manage exposure to credit-related losses. 48table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionallowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.the allowance for loan losses was $28.7 million or 2.08% of outstanding loans as of september 30, 2014 compared with $35.0 million or 2.53% of outstanding loans as of december 31, 2013.the allowance for loan losses decreased $6.3 million (net of charge-offs and recoveries) during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 as a result of net charge-offs exceeding additional provisions for loan losses.net charge-offs were $6.4 million during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared with $11.7 million during the same period in 2013.our provision for loan losses was $116 thousand during the nine months ended september 30, 2014 compared to $1.0 million recorded during the same period in 2013. we did not make any significant changes to our methodology or model for estimating the allowance for loan losses during any of the past three years.the allowance consists of specific, pooled (general), and unallocated components. table 4 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and other related information at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013.table 4:allowance for loan losses components and

determined to be impaired and, therefore, are individually evaluated for impairment.the specific component decreased during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, primarily due to the charge-off of loans with specific reserves.specific loan loss allocations decreased $7.6 million to $5.5 million at september 30, 2014 from $13.1 million at december 31, 2013.the general or pooled component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment.the pooled component of the allowance increased $1.6 million during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, from $17.6 million at december 31, 2013 to $19.2 million at september 30, 2014. the increase in the pooled component is the result of qualitative adjustments applied after an assessment of years to impairment for the various loan categories, consideration of macroeconomic factors, and evaluation of weighted historical loss rates.strong net recoveries also contributed to an increased general reserve without the need for provisioning.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses.the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance decreased modestly due to a combination of factors.macroeconomic indicators such as gdp, unemployment, and housing prices trended negatively during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, resulting in an increase in the portion of the unallocated component that considers external variables.however, the portion of the unallocated component that considers internal variables declined as a reflection of management‚Äôs assessment of the improved health of the portfolio and the high quality of the company‚Äôs credit processes. additionally, the continued resolution of troubled assets led to a reduction in the overall size of the loan portfolio and an improvement in the quality of the existing portfolio.  49table of contentshampton roads bankshares,

september 30, 2014, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses to be commensurate with the risk existing in our portfolio.however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations. notwithstanding these allocations, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge-offs in any loan category.non-performing assets. management classifies non-performing assets as those loans on which payments have been delinquent 90 days and are still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, and other real estate owned and repossessed assets. our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 3.56% and 5.29% at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013 we had no loans categorized as 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.loans in non-accrual status totaled $28.2 million and $39.9 million at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.loans are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, part of the balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans reach 90 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless there are extenuating circumstances. we had $22.8 million and $36.7 million of other real estate owned and repossessed assets at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.this decline was mainly due to sales of real estate owned outpacing new foreclosures and transfers in.the company‚Äôs largest borrower, as measured by total exposure, was downgraded to substandard in the quarter ended september 30, 2014.there is the potential for non-performing assets to materially increase should this borrower‚Äôs ability to repay become negatively affected.deposits. total deposits at september 30, 2014 were $1.6 billion, an increase of $89.3 million or 5.9% from the $1.5 billion at december 31, 2013.in recent years, our deposit composition has improved as a result of strategies to grow demand deposits, while de-emphasizing non-core certificates of deposit. at september 30, 2014, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $283.6 million, an increase of $38.2 million or 15.5% from $245.4 million at december 31, 2013. interest-bearing demand deposits at september 30, 2014 were  50table of contentshampton roads

september 30, 2014 balance of total deposits, which was a decrease of $1.2 million from the $43.6 million balance of brokered cds outstanding at december 31, 2013.the increase in total time deposits was primarily due to the company‚Äôs efforts to attract more local deposits.the company continues to focus on core deposit growth as its primary source of funding.core deposits are non-brokered and consist of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and time deposits of less than $100 thousand. core deposits increased $85.2

borrowing.at september 30, 2014, all our fhlb borrowings were long-term.we also possess additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements. shore maintains federal fund lines with two regional banking institutions and both banks have access to the frb discount window.these available lines totaled approximately $55.0 million at september 30, 2014 and none of these lines were utilized for borrowing purposes at september 30, 2014.capital resources. total shareholders‚Äô equity increased $11.6 million or 6.3% from december 31, 2013 to $195.4 million at september 30, 2014. the company and the banks are subject to regulatory capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.under capital

adequacy.tier i capital is comprised of shareholders‚Äô equity, net of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, certain debt instruments, less intangible assets, while total risk-based capital adds qualifying allowances for loan losses.as of september 30, 2014, our consolidated regulatory capital ratios were tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.01%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.13%, and total risk-based capital of 15.38%.as of september 30, 2014, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums, and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the

contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 3.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate sensitivity market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the company.fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the fair value of the company‚Äôs interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.the primary goal of our asset/liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment.our ability to manage our interest rate risk depends generally on our ability to match the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income.our management, guided by alco, determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.these decisions are based on management‚Äôs expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.the primary method that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets and liabilities over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures.this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon.key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments.the table below illustrates the expected effect on net interest income for the twelve months following september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013 due to an immediate change in interest rates.estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions, such as those previously discussed.effect on net interest incomeseptember 30, 2014december 31, 2013change in net interest incomechange in net interest income(in thousands, except for

pointsn/an/an/an/aas of september 30, 2014, we project an increase in net interest income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment. as of december 31, 2013, we projected a decrease in net interest income in both increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. dependent upon timing and shifts in the interest rate term structure, certain rising rate scenarios are less favorable due to lower levels of assets with short-term re-pricing characteristics, as well as due to the variable rate structure on the majority of our borrowings and the floors on many loans that will cause a delay in any interest income improvement. it should be noted, however, that the simulation analysis is based upon equivalent changes in interest rates for all categories of assets and liabilities.in normal operating conditions, interest rate changes rarely occur in such a uniform manner.many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments.in addition, management may deploy strategies that offset some of the impact of changes in interest rates.consequently, variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis.management maintains a simulation model where it is assumed that interest rate changes occur gradually, that rate increases for interest-bearing liabilities lag behind the rate increases of interest-earning assets, and that the level of deposit rate increases will be less than the level of rate increases for interest-earning assets.  53table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 4.controls and proceduresas of september 30, 2014, the company‚Äôs management, with the

agreement regarding this matter, under which the company would agree to pay $98,500 in civil penalties and provide indemnification for four specific loans, totaling approximately $748,000, for a period of five years from endorsement.the settlement agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing and has no material impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.item 1a ‚Äì risk factorsfor information regarding factors that could affect the company‚Äôs results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in the company‚Äôs 2013 form 10-k, part i, item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù.except as and to the extent disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the 2013 form 10-k.risks relating to our businessour success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members.we are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. while we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.we are not paying dividends on our common stock currently and absent regulatory approval are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.we paid cash dividends on our common stock prior to the third quarter of 2009.during the third quarter of 2009, we suspended dividend payments.we are prevented by our regulators from paying dividends until our financial position improves and, even once our financial condition improves, so long as we are subject to the mou we will need the prior consent of the frb and the bfi before the company may pay any dividend.bohr is subject to the same mou restriction on paying dividends to us. in addition, the retained deficit of bohr, our principal banking subsidiary, was $458.2 million as of september 30, 2014. absent permission from the virginia state corporation commission, bohr may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings.it is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay dividends if bohr cannot pay dividends to us.although we can seek to obtain a waiver of this prohibition and consent under the mou, our regulators may choose not to grant such a waiver and consent, and we would not expect to be granted a waiver or consent, or to be released  55table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationfrom these obligations, until our financial performance and retained earnings improve significantly.as a result, there is no assurance if or when we will be able to resume paying cash dividends. in addition, all dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and are dependent upon our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to our banking subsidiaries.if we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we are unable to pay dividends on our common stock.we had previously elected to defer payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company.however, we received approval from the frb and bfi under the mou to pay all previously deferred interest payments and have done so.while all previously deferred payments have been made, our outstanding trust preferred securities permit future deferrals and under the mou, future payments to service the trust preferred securities interest remain subject to regulatory approval.beginning in january 2010, we exercised our right to defer all quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities. the aggregate principal amount of all such series of debt securities is $50.7 million. our deferral of interest payments did not constitute an event of default. during the second quarter of 2014, we requested and were granted approval by regulatory authorities to discontinue the deferral period and to pay total accrued interest on the trust preferred securities of $6.2 million. we have made all such payments now and are current in our obligations under the trust preferred securities. upon receiving regulatory approval, the company made all required interest payments during the third quarter ended september 30, 2014, and intends to continue to make all quarterly interest payments, subject to regulatory approval. however, we do have the right to defer future quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities and under the mou we are prevented from making payments on an ongoing basis of any deferred interest on our trust preferred securities without the prior consent of the frb and bfi.we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the nine months ended september 30, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels. since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan defaults and net charge-offs that we have experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period. our net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the nine months ended september 30, 2014 was $8.3 million, and was $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 but our net loss attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the years ended december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011 was $25.1 million and $97.6 million, respectively.there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which have recently increased.our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.our mortgage banking earnings are dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors.loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. a significant portion of increases in our mortgage banking earnings over the last few years was due to historically low interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. as the interest rate environment began to return to more typical levels, starting in late summer of 2013 and continuing into 2014, mortgage loan refinancing activity was significantly reduced. loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions.any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly  56table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationreduce our income from mortgage banking activities.as a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations.the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.since april 2011, the sec‚Äôs division of enforcement (the ‚Äúdivision‚Äù) has been conducting a formal investigation into the company‚Äôs deferred tax asset valuation allowances, provision and allowance for loan losses, and other matters contained in its annual and quarterly reports for years 2008 through 2010.the company has fully cooperated with the division and intends to continue to do so. while the formal investigation is not over, the company has been in settlement negotiations with the division‚Äôs investigative staff for some months and currently expects a resolution in the near term. however, the settlement process is ongoing and therefore we cannot predict when this investigation will be finally resolved or what form the final outcome will take.it could result in material penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and may require significant time and attention from our management.economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition.at september 30, 2014, bohr and shore were classified as ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù for regulatory capital purposes.however, impairments to our loan or securities portfolio, declines in our earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time. if bohr or shore is unable to remain ‚Äúwell capitalized,‚Äù it will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area. as a result, it would be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered deposits mature and do not rollover and to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. if we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected.in addition, we would be required to pay higher insurance premiums to the fdic, which will reduce our earnings.virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock.our articles of incorporation, as well as the company‚Äôs bylaws (the ‚Äúbylaws‚Äù), contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of the company. these provisions include the ability of our board to set the price, term, and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock. our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for the ability of stockholders to call special meetings.similarly, the virginia stock corporation act contains provisions designed to protect virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. these provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. these provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of shareholders to change the composition of the board, to affect its policies generally, and to benefit from actions that are opposed by the current board.our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.the management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and to our ability to service our customer base.our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general.in managing our balance sheet, a primary source of funding is customer deposits. our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. our potential inability to maintain adequate sources of funding may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations. 57table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationan inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investments or loans, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include operating losses; rising levels of non-performing assets; a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated or as a result of a loss of confidence in us by our customers, lenders, and/or investors; or adverse regulatory action against us.our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry. the availability and level of deposits and other funding sources, including borrowings and the issuance of equity and debt securities, is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution, and such perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company. concerns about our financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity, financial position, regulatory capital ratios, results of operations, and our business prospects.our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.we face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial servicesthat serve our market area.a number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services.many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. as a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. while we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions serving our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions.if we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. failure to compete effectively to attract new, or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, growth, and the market price of our common stock.sales or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.the market price of our common stock could drop if our existing shareholders decide to sell their shares.as of september 30, 2014, anchorage, capgen, and carlyle owned 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock.pursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with these shareholders, the company has an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our common stock by each of the shareholders listed above. if any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly.in addition, sale of our common stock by anchorage, capgen, and carlyle could adversely impact our ability to realize certain deferred tax benefits relating to prior losses, thereby increasing our effective tax rate in the future.the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss.our business strategy centers, in part, on offering real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans secured by real estate in order to generate interest income.these types of loans generally have higher yields due to an elevated risk profile compared to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. at september 30, 2014 real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, and equity line lending (which includes junior lien mortgage loans) totaled $635.3 million, and $127.2 million, respectively. these loan categories combined represented approximately 54.2% of total loans.such loans increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have lower concentrations of real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans.loans secured by real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage properties are generally for larger amounts than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties.accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or  58table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationthe local economy.while we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.equity line lending allows a customer to access an amount up to their line of credit for the term specified in their agreement.at the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan.we cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines.while we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses. our loan portfolio contains loans used to finance construction and land development.construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property‚Äôs value at completion of construction, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction.if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project.if the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment.when lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal.although our underwriting criteria were designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to our operations.at september 30, 2014 we had loans of $131.5 million or 9.3% of total loans outstanding to finance construction and land development.construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance, however, in many cases such construction and development projects in our primary market areas are not being completed in a timely manner, if at all.a portion of our residential and real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage lending is secured by vacant or unimproved land.loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally more risky than loans secured by improved property for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. since vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business.these loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.with approximately three-fourths of our loans concentrated in the regions of hampton roads, richmond, the eastern shore of virginia, and the research triangle region of north carolina, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans.a decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses.also a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse.the local economies where the company does business are heavily reliant on military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that might result from recent congressional budgetary enactments.real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters.while our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property. we take into account all available information in assessing the fair value of other real estate owned and repossessed assets, including pending offers, recent appraisals, and other indicators.however, differences may exist between our estimate of fair value and the amount we ultimately realize upon sale, and such differences could be material.we have had large numbers of problem loans, relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so. 59table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationour non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrualloans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 3.56% and 5.29% at september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.  on september 30, 2014, less than 1% of our loans was 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets.the administration of non-performing loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our non-performing assets.the determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. we maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management‚Äôs best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans.our allowance for loan losses was $28.7 million at september 30, 2014, which represented 2.04% of our total loans, as compared to $35.0 million, or 2.53% of total loans, at december 31, 2013.the level of the allowance reflects management‚Äôs estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.for further discussion on the impact continued weak economic conditions have on the collateral underlying our loan portfolio, see ‚Äúif the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to further decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.‚Äùthe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.in addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans.such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.furthermore, certain proposed changes to gaap, if implemented as proposed, may require us to increase our estimate for losses embedded in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital.accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance for loan losses may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen.any such increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.our profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.these rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management‚Äôs view of our needs.changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the prices of securities, loans and deposits, and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business, and could result in decreases to our earnings. our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments.this could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.deposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. under current conditions, pricing pressures also may arise from depositors who demand premium interest rates from whatthey perceive to be a troubled financial institution. there is intense competition for deposits. the competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. in addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.furthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize fdic insurance coverage. in addition to  60table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationcompetitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. it is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. in order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term. finally, we may see interest rate pricing pressure from depositors concerned about our financial condition and levels of non-performing assets.we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams.financial institutions are a prime target of criminal activities through various channels of information technology. we attempt to mitigate risk from such activities through policies, procedures, and preventative and detective measures. in addition, we maintain insurance coverage designed to provide a level of financial protection to our business. however, risks posed by business interruption, fraud losses, business recovery expenses, and other potential losses or expenses that may be experienced from a significant event are not readily predictable and, therefore, could have an impact on our results of operations.our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area.because a substantial portion of our loans are with customers and businesses located in the central and coastal portions of virginia, north carolina, delaware, and maryland, catastrophic events, including natural disasters such as hurricanes which have historically struck the east coast of the united states with some regularity, or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our operations. any of these natural disasters or other catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our financial centers and customer base as well as collateral values and the strength of our loan portfolio. any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the market price of our common stock.the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division (‚Äúdoj‚Äù).although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of the related investigation.on november2, 2010, the company received from the doj a grand jury subpoena to produce information principally relating to the merger of gfh into the company on december31, 2008 and to loans made by gfh and its wholly-owned subsidiary, gateway, before gfh‚Äôs merger with the company. the doj has informed the company that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time, and we are fully cooperating.although we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company, we can give you no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of this investigation.the company is not aware of any recent developments in this matter and has not been notified of any developments in over a year. the company has not had contact with the doj related to the grand jury subpoena since april 2011.risks relating to market, legislative, and regulatory events our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry.the u.s. government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis.in addition to participating in the treasury‚Äôs tarp cpp, the u.s. government has taken steps that include enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, and increasing insured deposits.these programs subject us and other financial institutions who have participated in these programs to additional restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.compliance with such regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business  61table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationopportunities in an efficient manner.we also will be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.the increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact our results of operations.new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the u.s. congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry.federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.we cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on us.additional regulation could affect us in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors. we are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies.the regulators‚Äô interpretation and application of relevant regulations, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth.in addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into the mou with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before: either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind; the company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.all such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, the use of brokered deposits, and the creation of financial centers.although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors.the regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors.  62table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationthe fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states.its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin.it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities.its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. in addition, as a public company we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations.continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.in addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other requirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on july 21, 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank act into law. the dodd-frank act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. in addition, the law mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action.the dodd-frank act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness for the financial services sector.many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have begun to be or will be implemented over the next few years and will be subject to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies.because the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act will depend on future regulatory rulemaking and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. although management does not expect the dodd-frank act to have a material adverse effect on the company, it is not possible to predict at this time all the effects the dodd-frank act will have on the company and the rest of our industry.it is possible that the company‚Äôs interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital. on june 6, 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules to revise the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee in basel iii.these federal bank regulatory agencies approved final rules on july 2, 2013.the rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500.0 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (‚Äúbanking organizations‚Äù).although the final rules contain significant revisions from the proposed rules intended to provide relief to community banks, such as bohr and shore, many of the basel iii rules will apply to these institutions.among other things, the rules establish a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, changes in the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in the calculation of regulatory capital, and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property.the rules also limit a banking organization‚Äôs capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.for community banking organizations, the rules will be phased in beginning in 2015 and 2016.the company is diligently assessing the impact of this rule making on our capital and the amount of capital required to support our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.for further discussion of these issues, see the ‚Äúgovernment supervision and regulation‚Äùsection found in‚Äúpart i, item 1 ‚Äì business‚Äù of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, and incorporated by reference herein. 63table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationproposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.the cfpb has issued a rule designed to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the dodd-frank act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay a mortgage. loans that meet this definition of ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. under the cfpb‚Äôs rule, a ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù loan must not contain certain specified features, including:excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less ‚Äúbona fide discount points‚Äù for prime loans);interest-only payments;negative-amortization; andterms longer than 30 years.also, to qualify as a ‚Äúqualified mortgage,‚Äù a borrower‚Äôs total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. the cfpb‚Äôs rule on qualified mortgages and similar rules could limit our ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and time-consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry, generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.in addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us.there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of, or market for, our common stock. item 2 - unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceedsthe company announced an open ended program on august 13, 2003, by which management was authorized to repurchase an unlimited number of shares of the company‚Äôs

roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsnote a ‚Äì basis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of hampton roads bankshares, inc., (the ‚Äúcompany,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù), have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for interim financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-q.accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements.in the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation.the results of operations for the six months ended june 30, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.the company has two banking subsidiaries, bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù, collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù), which constitute substantially all of the company‚Äôs assets and operations. for further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the company‚Äôs annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013 (‚Äú2013 form 10-k‚Äù). use of estimates in the preparation of financial statementsthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) requires management to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.actual results could differ from those estimates. material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, determination of fair value for financial instruments, and tax assets, liabilities, and expenses.recent accounting pronouncementsduring the second quarter of 2014, accounting standards update (‚Äúasu‚Äù) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (‚Äúnew revenue standard‚Äù), was issued. asu 2014-09 represents a comprehensive reform of many of the revenue recognition requirements in gaap. the asu creates a new topic within the accounting standards codification (‚Äúasc‚Äù), topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. the new revenue standard will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition‚Äù, and supersedes or amends much of the industry-specific revenue recognition guidance found throughout the asc.the core principle of the new revenue standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. the asu creates a five-step process for achieving that core principle: (1) identifying the contract with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue when an entity has completed the performance obligations. the asu also requires additional disclosures that allow users of the financial statements to understand the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows resulting from contracts with customers. the guidance in the asu is effective for the company on january 1, 2017. the new revenue standard permits the use of retrospective or cumulative effect transition methods. it appears that substantially of the company‚Äôs contracts with customers (i.e., financial instruments) do not fall within the scope of the new revenue standard; however, the company is in the process of determining whether the asu will have a material impact on the company‚Äôs reported financial results and, if necessary, selecting a transition method.in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables ‚Äì troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon a foreclosure, which clarifies when banks and similar institutions (creditors) should reclassify mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties from the loan portfolio to other real estate owned (oreo). the asu defines when an in-substance repossession or foreclosure has occurred and when a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan. this asu allows for prospective or modified retrospective application. the effective date for public business entities is for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted.the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements. 8table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsin july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, income taxes, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented, with some exceptions, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.this update is effective for years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15, 2013.early adoption is permitted.the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.note b - regulatory matters effective june 9, 2010, the company and its banking subsidiary, bohr, entered into a written agreement (herein called the ‚Äúwritten agreement‚Äù) with the federal reserve bank of richmond (‚Äúfrb‚Äù) and the bureau of financial institutions of the virginia state corporation commission (‚Äúbureau of financial institutions‚Äù or ‚Äùbfi‚Äù).the written agreement was terminated on february 20, 2014 and the company and bohr are no longer subject to its terms and conditions.shore was not subject to the written agreement.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into a memorandum of understanding (the ‚Äúmou‚Äù) with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before, (i) either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind; (ii) the company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; (iii) the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or (iv) the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.during the three months ended june 30, 2014, we requested and were granted approval by regulatory authorities to pay total accrued interest on the trust preferred securities equaling $6.2 million.on april 14, 2014, the united states department of the treasury (‚Äútreasury‚Äù) sold its common stock, which it acquired through the company‚Äôs participation in the capital purchase program (‚Äúcpp‚Äù) of the treasury‚Äôs troubled asset relief program (‚Äútarp‚Äù). as a result of participation in tarp, our executives and certain of our employees were subject to compensation related limitations and restrictions, which applied so long as the treasury held the common stock it received in return for the financial assistance it provided us (disregarding any warrants to purchase our common stock that the treasury may hold). therefore, the compensation related limitations and restrictions will not apply to compensation earned after the treasury‚Äôs sale.in connection with the treasury‚Äôs sale, the company agreed to cancel certain restricted stock units that became non-payable under the treasury‚Äôs tarp regulations at the time of sale.note c - earnings per sharethe following table shows the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013.(in thousands, except

unrealized losses is expected to fluctuate with market interest rates.other-than-temporary impairment (‚Äúotti‚Äù)during the six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, no securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and no impairment losses were recognized through noninterest income.management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.in determining otti, management considers many factors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.the assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.when otti occurs, the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss.if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss, the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment‚Äôs amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.maturities of investment securitiesthe amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity of investment securities available for sale that are not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013are shown below. expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, and equity securities, which do not have contractual maturities, are shown separately.  11table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem

as there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb or member institutions.therefore, when evaluating fhlb stock for impairment, its value is based on ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value.the company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and no

decreased by $9.7 millionor 13.7% compared to the first quarter of 2014.  collateral dependent impaired loans were $55.5 million and $61.9 million at june 30, 2014, and december 31, 2013, respectively, and are measured at the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. impaired loans for which no allowance is provided totaled $34.0 million and $34.7 million at june 30, 2014, and december 31, 2013, respectively. loans written down to their estimated fair value of collateral less the costs to sell account for $7.8 million and $9.4 million of the impaired loans for

to nonaccrual status, that were modified as tdr‚Äôs within the previous twelve months.loans that are considered tdrs are considered specifically impaired and the primary consideration for measurement of impairment is the present value of the expected cash flows.however, given the prevalence of real estate secured loans in the company‚Äôs portfolio of troubled assets, the majority of the company‚Äôs tdr loans are  23table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsultimately considered collateral-dependent.as a practical expedient, impairments are, therefore, calculated based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.observable market prices for the sale of the respective notes are not considered as a basis for impairment for any of the company‚Äôs impaired loans.in determining the estimated fair valueof collateral dependent impaired loans, the company uses third party appraisals and, if necessary, utilizes a proprietary database of its own historical property appraisals in conjunction with external data and applies a relevant discount derived from analysis of appraisals of similar property type, vintage, and geographic location (for example, in situations where the most recent available appraisal is aged and an updated appraisal has not yet been received).the company does not participate in any government or company sponsored tdr programs and holds no corresponding assets.rather, loans are individually modified in situations where the company believes it will minimize the probability of losses to the company.additionally, the company had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing receivables whose terms have been modified in tdrs at june 30, 2014.note f - other real estate owned and repossessed assetsthe following table shows a rollforward of other real estate owned and repossessed assets for the six months ended june 30, 2014.

-$747$232$1,608$(1,866)note i - derivative instrumentsderivatives are a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying assets.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.in connection with the underwriting process, the company enters into commitments to lock-in the interest rate of the loan with the borrower prior to funding (‚Äúinterest rate lock commitments‚Äù).generally, such interest rate lock commitments are for periods less than 60 days.these interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives.the company manages its exposure to changes in fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments by entering into simultaneous agreements to sell the residential loans to third party investors shortly after their origination and funding.at june 30, 2014 and at december 31, 2013 the company had loans held for sale of $30.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively. 28table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsunder the contractual relationship in the best efforts method, the company is obligated to sell the loans only if the loans close. as a result of the terms of these contractual relationships, the company is not exposed tochanges in fair value nor will it realize gains related to its interest ratelock commitments due to subsequent changes in interest rates.at june 30, 2014 and at december 31, 2013, the company had rate-lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans (unfunded par amount of loans) on a best efforts basis in the amounts of $58.5 million and $35.6 million, respectively.from september 2012to december 2013, the company sold some of its mortgage loan production on a mandatory delivery basis and using derivative instruments (essentially forward delivery commitments and to-be-announced securities) to manage the resulting interest rate risk.these derivatives were entered into as balance sheet risk management instruments, and therefore, were not designated as an accounting hedge.under the mandatory delivery approach, residential mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates exposed the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment until the loans are delivered to the investor.also, the decrease in the carrying value of the underlying loans and interest rate lock commitments totaled $247 thousand during that same period. gains and losses on the company‚Äôs derivative instruments are included within mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.additionally, to meet the needs of its commercial customers, the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.derivative contracts are executed between the company and certain commercial loan customers with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program enabling the commercial loan customers to effectively exchange variable-rate interest payments under their existing obligations for fixed-rate interest payments.for the six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, the company recorded gains totaling $79 thousand and $514 thousand, respectively, related to trading income on the interest rate swaps included in the back-to-back swap program that was included within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.as of june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the company has derivative financial instruments not included in hedge relationships.these derivatives consist of interest rate swaps used for interest rate management purposes and derivatives executed with commercial banking customers to facilitate their interest rate management strategies.certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet and/or subject to master netting arrangements.the company‚Äôs derivative transactions with financial institution counterparties are generally executed under international swaps and derivative association (‚Äúisda‚Äù) master agreements which include ‚Äúright of setoff‚Äù provisions.in such cases there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and there may be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis.nonetheless, the company does not generally offset financial instruments for financial reporting purposes.

measurement date.the company classifies financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.valuation methodologies for the fair value hierarchy are as follows.level 1 ‚Äì quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.level 2 ‚Äì observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose values are determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. level 3 ‚Äì unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.level 3 assets and liabilities include values that are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. the categorization of an asset or liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.recurring basisthe company measures or monitors certain of its assets on a fair value basis.fair value is used on a recurring basis for those assets and liabilities for which an election was made as well as for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting.the following tables reflect the fair value of assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at june 30, 2014

estimate fair value for our assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis.investment securities available for sale.where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products, and exchange traded equities.if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.level 2 securities would include u.s. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed, and other securities valued using third party quoted prices in markets that are not active.in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. derivative loan commitments.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.under the best efforts basis, the company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate is fixed prior to funding.these commitments, in which the company intends to sell in the secondary market, are considered freestanding derivatives.under the mandatory delivery basis, mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates expose the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment.the fair values of interest rate lock and mandatory delivery commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as level 3, are based on quoted prices adjusted for commitments that the company does not expect to fund.interest rate swaps. the company uses observable inputs to determine fair value of its interest rate swaps.the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques that are based on discounted cash flow analysis using the expected cash flows of each derivative over the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and market-based interest rate curves.the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments.the variable cash payments were based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.accordingly, the company categorizes these financial instruments within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 32table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsnonrecurring basiscertain assets, specifically collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment and an allowance is established to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value).the adjustments are based on appraisals of underlying collateral or other observable market prices when current appraisals or observable market prices are available.where we do not have an appraisal that is less than 12 months old, an existing appraisal or other valuation would be utilized after discounting it to reflect current market conditions, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. to assist in the discounting process, a valuation matrix was developed to provide valuation guidance for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned where it was deemed that an existing appraisal was outdated as to current market conditions.the matrix applies discounts to external appraisals depending on the type of real estate and age of the appraisal.the discounts are generally specific point estimates; however in some cases, the matrix allows for a small range of values.the discounts were based in part upon externally derived statistical data.the discounts were also based upon management‚Äôs knowledge of market conditions and prices of sales of other real estate owned. in addition, matrix value adjustments may be made by our independent appraisal group to reflect property value trends within specific markets as well as actual sales data from market transactions and/or foreclosed real estate sales.it is the company‚Äôs policy to classify these as level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy.the weighted average age of appraisals for valuations of collateral dependent impaired loans was 0.55 years as of june 30, 2014 and 0.73 years as of december 31, 2013.management periodically reviews the discounts in the matrix as compared to valuations from updated appraisals and modifies the discounts accordingly should updated appraisals reflect valuations significantly different than those derived utilizing the matrix.to date, management believes the appraisal discount matrix has resulted in appropriate adjustments to existing appraisals thereby providing management with reasonable valuations for the collateral underlying the loan portfolio; however, while appraisals are indicators of fair value, the amount realized upon sale of these assets could be significantly different.  33table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to

loans.the majority of the company‚Äôs impaired loans are considered collateral dependent. for collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.  due to the nature of real-estate appraisals and the discounts applied by the company in determining fair value of the underlying collateral as described previously, collateral-dependent loans are considered level 3 financial instruments.other real estate owned and repossessed assets.the adjustments to other real estate owned and repossessed assets are based primarily on appraisals of the real estate or other observable market prices.our policy is that fair values for these assets are based on current appraisals.in most cases, we maintain current appraisals for these items.where we do not have a current appraisal, an existing appraisal would be utilized after discounting it to reflect changes in market conditions from the date of the existing appraisal, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. branch consolidation. on march 27, 2013, the company announced the consolidation of seven bohr and shore branch locations, six owned and one leased, into nearby branches.this required an impairment analysis to be performed.in connection with the analysis, five of the branch locations were determined to have carrying amounts that exceeded fair value at march 31, 2013.accordingly, the related carrying amounts of these branches were reduced to estimated fair value (less costs to sell) and the company recorded an impairment totaling $2.8 million during the quarter ended march 31, 2013.management estimated the fair value of the branches by utilizing various market-based valuation techniques, including estimates from unrelated brokers, existing purchase offers from unrelated parties, and appraisals available as of the measurement date.approximately $3.4 million related to the remaining carrying values of the branch related assets was transferred into other real estate owned in accordance with relevant accounting guidance and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 34table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementssignificant unobservable inputsthe

sellother fair value measurementsadditionally, accounting standards require the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value. for the financial instruments that the company does not record at fair value, estimates of fair value are made at a point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument.no readily available market exists for a significant portion of the company‚Äôs financial instruments.fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, interest rate risk characteristics, and other factors. many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument.in addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates.the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating fair value of these financial instruments. (a) cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(b)investment securities available for salefair values are based on published market prices where available. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow.investment securities available for sale are carried at their aggregate fair value. (c)restricted equity securitiesthese investments are carried at costas there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb, frb, or member institutions.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(d)loans held for salethe carrying value of loans held for sale is a reasonable estimate of fair value since loans held for sale are expected to be sold within a short period.  35table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statements(e)loansto determine the fair values of loans other than those listed as nonaccrual, we use discounted cash flow analyses.in these analyses, we use discount rates that are similar to the interest rates and terms currently being offered to borrowers of similar terms and credit quality.for nonaccrual loans, we use a variety of techniques to measure fair value, such as using the current appraised value of the collateral, discounting the contractual cash flows, and analyzing market data that we may adjust due to the specific characteristics of the loan or collateral.(f)interest receivable and interest payablethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(g)bank-owned life insurancethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(h)depositsthe fair values disclosed for transaction deposits such as demand and savings accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (this is, their carrying values).the carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date.fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on comparable instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.(i)borrowingsthe fair value of borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.these include fhlb borrowings and other borrowings. (j)commitments to extend credit and standby letters of creditthe only amounts recorded for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are the deferred fees arising from these unrecognized financial instruments.these deferred fees are not deemed significant at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and as such, the related fair values have not been estimated.the carrying amounts and fair values of those financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013 were as follows.june 30, 2014carryingfairfair value measurements at

from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.they are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments, or results, you should carefully review the risk factors summarized below and the more detailed discussion in the ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù section of this report.our risks include, without limitation, the following:our success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members;we are not paying dividends on our common stock and currently are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;we had previously elected to defer payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company.however, we received approval from the frb and bfi under the mou to pay all previously deferred interest payments and have done so.while all deferred payments have been made, our outstanding trust preferred securities permit future deferrals and under the mou,future payments to service the trust preferred securities interest remain subject to regulatory approval;the volcker rule collateralized loan obligation provisions could result in adverse consequences for us, including lower earnings, lower tangible capital and/or lower regulatory capital;we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the six months ended june 30, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels;our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations;the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements;economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition;virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock; our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations;our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry; sales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price;the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss;if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; 38table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionwe have had large numbers of problem loans relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so;the determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected;our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk;we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability;we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams;our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area;the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division.although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of the related investigation;our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities;banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors; the fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;proposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans and/or attract certain types of deposits; and the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.our forward-looking statements could be incorrect in light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.the future events, developments, or results described in this report could turn out to be materially different.we have no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements after the date of this report and you should not expect us to do so.critical accounting policiesu.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex assumptions, judgments, and estimates.our assumptions, judgments, and estimates may be incorrect, and changes in such assumptions, judgments, and estimates may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.actual results, in fact, could differ materially from those estimates.we consider our policies on allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred taxes, and the valuation of other real estate owned to be critical accounting policies.refer to our 2013 form 10-k for further discussion of these policies.material trends and uncertaintiesgeneral economic conditions in our major markets remained uneven for the six months ended june 30, 2014. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the hampton roads region‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in june 2014, compared to 5.3% in december 2013.our region saw a 0.3% increase in nonfarm employment between june 2013 and june 2014.through may 2014 our region had experienced declines in employment this year mainly due to defense cuts in federal government civilian jobs.with nearly half of the hampton roads local economy driven by the military spending, any cuts in federal spending have a direct impact on the economic growth rate.although the company‚Äôs overall loan growth is down 1.5% during the six months ended june 30, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013, the second quarter produced a 1.0% growth over first quarter.this growth in the second quarter was driven by a strong performance in real estate - commercial mortgage, which grew by 6.8%.the wall  39table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionstreet journal recently reported that debate is intensifying among federal reserve regional bank presidents about whether to push interest rates up sooner than planned because of recent improvements in the u.s economy.however, it still appears that the federal reserve‚Äôs intention is to continue to maintain a low interest rate environment at least into 2015.the current low interest rate environment will continue to place downward pressure on our net interest income and our overall operating net income.due to the continued improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio, non-performing assets have declined 22.4% since december 31, 2013, reducing the drag on income related to these problem assets. the elevation of mortgage interest rates which began in late summer 2013, has caused a dramatic decline in refinancing activity, and will continue to put downward pressure on overall mortgage banking revenue. due to cost reduction initiatives implemented over the last few years, noninterest expense has declined, thus improving our overall efficiency.for further discussion of the material trends and uncertainties that may affect our results and financial condition, refer to the risk factors contained part ii item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù in this report.company overviewhampton roads bankshares, inc. (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in virginia beach, virginia.the company‚Äôs primary subsidiaries are bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù).the banks engage in general community and commercial banking business, targeting the needs of individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in our primary service areas.currently, bohr operates 17 full-service offices in the hampton roads region of southeastern virginia and 10 full-service offices throughout richmond, virginia and the northeastern and research triangle regions of north carolina that do business as gateway bank & trust co. (‚Äúgateway‚Äù).shore operates 7 full-service offices in the eastern shore of virginia and maryland and 3 loan production offices in maryland and delaware.through various affiliates, the banks also offer mortgage banking and marine financing.our largest investor shareholders include anchorage capital group, l.l.c. (‚Äúanchorage‚Äù), capgen capital group vi lp (‚Äúcapgen‚Äù), and the carlyle group, l.p. (‚Äúcarlyle‚Äù).anchorage, capgen, and carlyle own 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of june 30, 2014. our primary source of revenue is net interest income earned by our bank subsidiaries.net interest income represents interest and fees earned from lending and investment activities less the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.net interest income may be impacted by variations in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the yields earned and the rates paid, level of non-performing assets, and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support earning assets.in addition to net interest income, noninterest income is another important source of revenue.noninterest income is derived primarily from service charges on deposits and mortgage banking revenue.gains and losses on the sale or impairment of our other real estate owned and repossessed assets are recognized in noninterest income.other significant factors that impact net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. are the provision for loan losses, and noninterest expense.the direct lending activities in which the company engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. as such, interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve") and general economic conditions, nationally and in the company's primary market areas, have a significant impact on the company's results of operations. to the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the company in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the company. regarding net interest margin, the company makes fixed rate loans, whereby general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce the company's spread as the interest rates the company must pay for deposits may increase while interest income may be unchanged. economic conditions may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans and the ability to liquidate that property to satisfy a loan if necessary.the company's goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures and modifying those policies on occasion to account for changing or emerging risks or changing market conditions, evaluating each borrower's business plan and financial condition during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and maintaining sufficient collateral to mitigate economic loss in the event of liquidation. an allowance for loan losses has been established which consists of general, specific, and unallocated components. a risk rating system is employed to estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting  40table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditiongeneral reserve allocations.the general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for specific impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated for potential loss.the specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment.the specific allowance for loan losses is based on a loan-by-loan analysis and varies between impaired loans largely due to the value of the loan‚Äôs underlying collateral.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses and considers internal portfolio management effectiveness and external macroeconomic factors.overview of results of operations and financial conditionthe following commentary provides information about the major components of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources.this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan defaults and net charge-offs that we experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.the company reported net income for the six months ended june 30, 2014, as it did for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to the net operating losses from 2009 to 2012.this improvement in net income primarily resulted from improved general economic conditions and credit performance of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio. there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which increased in 2013, resulting in significantly lower revenue in our mortgage segment. the company also recognized $3.5 million in income from bank-owned life insurance for the six months ended june 30, 2014, which is significantly higher than the company‚Äôs historic or expected bank-owned life insurance income.as of june 30, 2014, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the following is a summary of our financial condition as of june 30, 2014 and our financial performance for the three and six months then ended.assets were $2.0 billion at june 30, 2014.total assets increased by $25.2 million or 1.3% from december 31, 2013.the increase in assets was primarily associated with a $29.3 million or 68.4% increase in overnight funds sold and due from frb, a $21.3 million or 6.5% increase in investment securities available for sale, a$9.0 million or 25.6% decrease in the allowance for loan losses, a $5.5 million or 21.7% increase in loans held for sale, partially offset by a $20.7 million or 1.5% decrease in gross loans, and a $14.3 million or 38.9% decrease in other real estate owned and foreclosed real estate.investment securities available for sale increased $21.3 million or 6.5% to $346.8 million as of june 30, 2014 from $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the net unrealized gains in our total portfolio and purchases of mortgage-backed securities.gross loans decreased by $20.7 million or 1.5% during the six months ended june 30, 2014, primarily due to normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume.impaired loans decreased by $6.4 million during the six months ended june 30, 2014 to $61.2 million at june 30, 2014, down from $67.6 million at december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a downward trend in non-accrual commercial construction loans.allowance for loan losses at june 30, 2014 decreased 25.6% to $26.1 million from $35.0 million at december 31, 2013 as net charge-offs of previously identified impaired loans exceeded additional provisions for loan losses. in particular, the specific component of the allowance for loan losses decreased to $6.8 million from $13.1 million. 41table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditiondeposits at june 30, 2014 increased $38.2 million or 2.5% from december 31, 2013 as a result of increases of $21.5 million or 8.8% in non-interest bearing demand deposits, increases of $16.4 million or 5.1% in time deposits less than $100 thousand, increases of $5.6 million in time deposits over $100 thousand, partially offset by decreases of $4.7 million or 7.5% in savings deposits.net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 was $2.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, as compared with net income for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 of $89 thousand and $721 thousand, respectively.net interest income decreased $1.1 million and $2.0 million in the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013. the decreases were due primarily to the decreases in average interest-earning assets, and a slight decline in net interest margin.the continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio quality resulted in no loan loss provision needed during the three months ended june 30, 2014, allowing the total loan loss provision for the six months ended june 30, 2014 to remain at $100 thousand. substantially all charge-offs year-to-date related to impaired loans with specific reserves as of december 31, 2013.noninterest income for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 was $5.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively, a decline of 27.2% and 1.5%from the same periods in 2013.  a major driver of this decline is mortgage banking revenue which decreased $1.1 million or 26.0% and $5.3 million or 51.5% during the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.the decrease in mortgage banking revenue is due to declines in both origination volume and margin, driven by rising market interest rates, which resulted ina dramatic negative impact on refinance demand. offsetting these declines were decreases in losses on premises and equipment associated with certain branch closings in the

income, a major component of our earnings, is the difference between the income generated by interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.net interest margin, which is calculated by expressing annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, is an indicator of effectiveness in generating income from earning assets. net interest income and net interest margin may be significantly impacted by the market interest rates (rate); the mix, duration, and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume); changes in the yields earned and rates paid; and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support interest-earning assets.our management team strives to maximize net interest income

conditioninterest-earning assets consist of loans, investment and restricted equity securities, overnight funds sold and due from frb, and interest-bearing deposits in other banks and interest-bearing liabilities consist of deposit accounts and borrowings. net interest income for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 was $15.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million or 6.6% and $2.0 million or 6.4%, as compared to the same periods in 2013. net interest margin for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 was 3.33% and 3.36%, respectively, down from 3.44% for the comparable periods in 2013.in the current low interest rate environment, the company expects to continue to experience downward pressure on net interest margin, as rates on interest earning assets decline at a faster pace than that of our interest-bearing liabilities.interest income on loans, including fees, decreased predominantly as the result of a decline in the average yield on loans and a decline in average loan balances.interest income on investment securities increased due to higher reinvestment rates, slower prepayment speeds and security allocation.interest income on overnight funds sold and due from frb decreased modestly.  the decrease in interest expense on deposits resulted from a decline in average interest-bearing deposits and an overall decrease in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits. interest expense on borrowings, which consisted of fhlb borrowings and other borrowings, decreased mainly due to maturing fhlb advances being paid down, as well as the overall lower average interest rate paid on borrowings.in 2011, following a review of the company‚Äôs current level of assumed interest rate risk and to promote liquidity and enhance current earnings, the company modified certain advances with the fhlb. a majority of the company‚Äôs existing fixed-rate advances were restructured as floating rate obligations at a fixed spread to three month libor with maturities ranging from 2.75 to 4 years. noninterest incomefor the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, total noninterest income was $5.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively, a decrease of $2.1 million or 27.2% and $189 thousand or 1.5%, compared to the same periods in 2013. we define total revenue as the sum of interest income and non-interest

normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume, the company experienced an increase in the overall level of cash and cash equivalents.in the future, the company expects to utilize its cash on hand to support future loan origination activity.  during the second quarter of 2014, we utilized a portion of our cash balances to pay total accrued interest on the trust preferred securities of $6.2 million.investment securities. our investment portfolio at june 30, 2014 consisted primarily of u.s. agency, mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities.the allocation to asset-backed securities, which began in 2013, provides the company with a floating rate asset, which mitigates the interest rate risk inherent in certain other asset classes, e.g., mortgage backed securities (‚Äúmbs‚Äù).repayment of principal and interest of the abs security is dependent upon the performance of the underlying loan collateral.the company performs due diligence of each security on a pre- and post-purchase basis to evaluate the underlying collateral and invests in the investment grade tranches of securitizations.however, should defaults or loss severities exceed the credit enhancement in the structure, payment of principal or interest may be impacted. our available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value and are used primarily for liquidity, pledging, earnings, and asset/liability management purposes and are reviewed quarterly for possible impairment. due to portfolio activity, the fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities at june 30, 2014 increased $21.3 million or 6.5% to $346.8 million compared to $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.loans. as a holding company of two community banks, we have a primary objective of meeting the business and consumer credit needs within our markets where standards of profitability, client relationships, and credit quality intersect.our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment loans.lending decisions are based upon evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan.personal guarantees are required on most loans; however, prudent exceptions are made on occasion based upon the financial viability of the borrowing entity or the underlying project that is being financed.overall our loan trends during the six months ended june 30, 2014 have been influenced by continued soft demand for loans in nearly all our loan categories.our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased $27.4 million to the june 30, 2014 balance of $198.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $225.5 million.construction loans decreased $20.4 million to the june 30, 2014 balance of $138.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $158.5 million.our real estate-commercial mortgage loan portfolio increased $38.3 million to the june 30, 2014 balance of $628.8 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $590.5 million. the company has experienced greater demand for commercial real estate related credit relative to other loan types.credit concentrations are measured against internal and regulatory prudential guidelines.the real estate-residential mortgage loan portfolio showed a modest decrease to $347.8 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $354.0 million. the installment loan portfolio decreased $5.5 million to the june 30, 2014 balance of $52.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $57.6 million.in addition to the aforementioned soft demand for credit, the contraction seen in loans stems from the continued resolution of problem loans.origination volumes were also offset by principal pay-downs and scheduled amortization in the portfolio.additionally, our prudent business practices and internal guidelines and underwriting standards will continue to be followed in making lending decisions in order to manage exposure to credit-related losses.allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.the allowance for loan losses was $26.1 million or 1.91% of outstanding loans as of june 30, 2014 compared with $35.0 million or 2.53% of outstanding loans as of december 31, 2013. 48table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionthe allowance for loan losses decreased $9.0 million (net of charge-offs and recoveries) during the six months ended june 30, 2014 as a result of net charge-offs exceeding additional provisions for loan losses.net charge-offs were $9.1 million during the six months ended june 30, 2014 compared with $11.1 million during the same period in 2013.our provision for loan losses was $100 thousand during the six months ended june 30, 2014 compared to $1.0 million recorded during the same period in 2013. we did not change our methodology or model for estimating the allowance for loan losses during any of the past three years.the allowance consists of specific, pooled (general), and unallocated components. table 4 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and other related information at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013.table 4:allowance for

losses relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, are individually evaluated for impairment.the specific component decreased during the six months ended june 30, 2014, primarily due to the charge-off of loans with specific reserves.specific loan loss allocations decreased $6.3 million to $6.8 million at june 30, 2014 from $13.1 million at december 31, 2013.the general or pooled component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment.the pooled component of the allowance decreased $2.5 million during the six months ended june 30, 2014, from $17.6 million at december 31, 2013 to $15.1 million at june 30, 2014. the decrease in the pooled component is the result of (i) lower historical loss factors applied in our models, as higher charge-offs in older periods are replaced with lower charge-offs in more recent periods, (ii) changes in portfolio mix, as categories with higher pooled reserve levels such as construction loans have continued to decline, and (iii) continued improvement in credit quality as evidenced by improved internal weighted average loan grades.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses.the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance decreased modestly due to a combination of factors.macroeconomic indicators such as gdp, unemployment, and housing prices trended negatively during the six months ended june 30, 2014, resulting in an increase in the portion of the unallocated component that considers external variables.however, the portion of the unallocated component that considers internal variables declined as a reflection of management‚Äôs assessment of the improved health of the portfolio and the high quality of the company‚Äôs credit processes. additionally, the continued resolution of troubled assets led to a reduction in the overall size of the loan portfolio and an improvement in the quality of the existing portfolio.  49table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis

risk existing in our portfolio.however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations. notwithstanding these allocations, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge-offs in any loan category.non-performing assets. management classifies non-performing assets as those loans on which payments have been delinquent 90 days and are still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, and foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets. our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 4.19% and 5.29% at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013 we had loans totaling $843 thousand and $0, respectively, categorized as 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.loans in non-accrual status totaled $36.1 million and $39.9 million at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.loans are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, part of the balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans reach 90 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless there are extenuating circumstances. we had $22.4 million and $36.7 million of other real estate owned and repossessed assets at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.this decline was mainly due to sales of real estate owned outpacing inflows. deposits. total deposits at june 30, 2014 were $1.6 billion, an increase of $38.2 million or 2.5% from the $1.5 billion at december 31, 2013.in recent years, our deposit composition has improved as a result of strategies to grow demand deposits, while de-emphasizing higher rate and non-core certificates of deposit. deposits at june 30, 2014 increased $38.2 million or 2.5% from december 31, 2013 as a result of increases of $21.5 million or 8.8% in non-interest bearing demand deposits, increases of $16.4 million or 5.1% in time deposits less than $100 thousand, increases of $5.6 million in time deposits

and qualitative measures to ensure capital adequacy.tier i capital is comprised of shareholders‚Äô equity, net of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, certain debt instruments, less intangible assets, while total risk-based capital adds qualifying allowances for loan losses.as of june 30, 2014, our consolidated regulatory capital ratios were tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.10%,

is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the company.fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the fair value of the company‚Äôs interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.the primary goal of our asset/liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment.our ability to manage our interest rate risk depends generally on our ability to match the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income.our management, guided by alco, determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.these decisions are based on management‚Äôs expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.the primary method that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets and liabilities over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures.this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon.key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments.the table below illustrates the expected effect on net interest income for the twelve months following june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013 due to an immediate change in interest rates.estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions, such as those previously discussed.effect on net interest incomejune 30, 2014december 31, 2013change in net interest incomechange in net interest income(in thousands, except for percentages)amount%amount%change in interest rates:+200 basis points$1,0181.71%$(1,114)(1.82)%+100 basis points3890.65(593)(0.97)-100 basis points(1,857)(3.12)(1,265)(2.07)-200 basis pointsn/an/an/an/aas of june 30, 2014, we project an increase in net interest income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment. as of december 31, 2013, we projected a decrease in net interest income in both increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. dependent upon timing and shifts in the interest rate term structure, certain rising rate scenarios are less favorable due to lower levels of assets with short-term re-pricing characteristics, as well as due to the variable rate structure on the majority of our borrowings and the floors on many loans that will cause a delay in any interest income improvement. it should be noted, however, that the simulation analysis is based upon equivalent changes in interest rates for all categories of assets and liabilities.in normal operating conditions, interest rate changes rarely occur in such a uniform manner.many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments.in addition, management may deploy strategies that offset some of the impact of changes in interest rates.consequently, variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis.management maintains a simulation model where it is assumed that interest rate changes occur gradually, that rate increases for interest-bearing liabilities lag behind the rate increases of interest-earning assets, and that the level of deposit rate increases will be less than the level of rate increases for interest-earning assets.  53table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 4.controls and proceduresas of june 30, 2014, the company‚Äôs management, with the

management,including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. in addition, no change in its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934) occurred during the six months ended june 30, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 54table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationitem 1 - legal proceedingsin the ordinary course of operations, the company may become a party to legal proceedings.based upon information currently available, management believes that such legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations except as provided below.in april 2011, the sec informed the company that it is conducting a formal investigation related to certain accounting matters.for a further discussion of this matter, see section ‚Äúrisk factors ‚Äì risks relating to our business ‚Äì the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.‚Äùon november 2, 2010, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division.for a discussion of this matter, see section ‚Äúrisk factors ‚Äì risks relating to our business ‚Äì the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division.although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or the eventual outcome of the related investigation.‚Äùon november 6, 2013, the company received a notice of violation and intent to seek civil money penalty from the u.s. department of housing and urban development (‚Äúhud‚Äù) stating that hud is considering taking administrative action against and imposing civil money penalties on gateway mortgage, a subsidiary of bohr, for certain asserted violations of hud and federal housing administration requirements. the company and hud have entered into a settlement agreement regarding this matter, under which the company would agree to pay $98,500 in civil penalties and provide indemnification for four specific loans, totaling approximately $748,000, for a period of five years from endorsement.the settlement agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing and has no material impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.item 1a ‚Äì risk factorsfor information regarding factors that could affect the company‚Äôs results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in the company‚Äôs 2013 form 10-k, part i, item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù.except as and to the extent disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the 2013 form 10-k.risks relating to our businessour success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members.we are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. while we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.we are not paying dividends on our common stock currently and absent regulatory approval are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.we paid cash dividends on our common stock prior to the third quarter of 2009.during the third quarter of 2009, we suspended dividend payments.we are prevented by our regulators from paying dividends until our financial position improves and, even once our financial condition improves, so long as we are subject to the mou we will need the prior consent of the frb and the bfi before the company may pay any dividend.bohr is subject to the same mou restriction on paying dividends to us. in addition, the retained deficit of bohr, our principal banking subsidiary, was $460.7 million as of june 30, 2014. absent permission from the virginia state corporation commission, bohr may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings.it is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay dividends if bohr cannot pay dividends to us.although we can seek to obtain a waiver of this prohibition and consent under the mou, our regulators may choose not to grant such a waiver and consent, and we would not expect to be granted a waiver or consent, or to be released  55table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationfrom these obligations, until our financial performance and retained earnings improve significantly.as a result, there is no assurance if or when we will be able to resume paying cash dividends. in addition, all dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and are dependent upon our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to our banking subsidiaries.if we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we are unable to pay dividends on our common stock.we had previously elected to defer payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company.however, we received approval from the frb and bfi under the mou to pay all deferred interest payments and have done so.while all deferred payments have been made, our outstanding trust preferred securities permit future deferrals and under the mou, future payments to service the trust preferred securities interest remain subject to regulatory approval.beginning in january 2010, we exercised our right to defer all quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities. the aggregate principal amount of all such series of debt securities is $50.7 million. our deferral of interest payments did not constitute an event of default. during the second quarter of 2014, we requested and were granted approval by regulatory authorities to discontinue the deferral period and to pay total accrued interest on the trust preferred securities of $6.2 million. we have made all such payments now and are current in our obligations under the trust preferred securities. however, we do have the right to defer future quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities and under the mou we are prevented from making payments on an ongoing basis of any deferred interest on our trust preferred securities without the prior consent of the frb and bfi.the volcker rule collateralized loan obligation provisions could result in adverse consequences for us, including lower earnings, lower tangible capital and/or lower regulatory capitalthe so-called ‚Äúvolcker rule‚Äù provisions of the dodd-frank act restrict the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions, such as the banks, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. the federal reserve adopted final rules implementing the volcker rule in december 2013. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the volcker rule and the final rules adopted thereunder. we own $5.0 million of clo securities with a weighted average yield of 2.85% that are subject to the volcker rule. if we decide to sell or are required to sell these securities, our future net interest income could be adversely impacted if our alternative use for these funds yields a lower rate. while there is a potential for additional regulatory guidance or a legislative ruling that would enable banks to continue to hold clo securities under the volcker rule, to the extent this does not materialize nor do the regulators accept any structural solutions put forth by the financial services industry, we are currently subject to potentially significant price movements in these securities which could adversely impact our tangible capital. for instance, a hypothetical 10% reduction in current clo market prices would result in a $6.4 million reduction to our current clo securities valuation. since these securities are currently held as available for sale, the resulting change in other comprehensive income (loss) would be approximately $6.4 million. further, if we decide to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell such securities before recovery, we may recognize losses that could adversely impact our regulatory capital ratios. a loss of $6.4 million would lower regulatory capital by 27 basis points.we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the six months ended june 30, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels. since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan defaults and net charge-offs that we have experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.  56table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationour net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the six months ended june 30, 2014 was $6.3 million, and was $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 but our net loss attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the years ended december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011 was $25.1 million and $97.6 million, respectively.there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which have recently increased.our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.our mortgage banking earnings are dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors.loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. a significant portion of increases in our mortgage banking earnings over the last few years was due to historically low interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. as the interest rate environment began to return to more typical levels, starting in late summer of 2013 and continuing into 2014, mortgage loan refinancing activity was significantly reduced. loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions.any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities.as a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations.the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.since april 2011, the sec‚Äôs division of enforcement (the ‚Äúdivision‚Äù) has been conducting a formal investigation into the company‚Äôs deferred tax asset valuation allowances, provision and allowance for loan losses, and other matters contained in its annual and quarterly reports for years 2008 through 2010.the company has fully cooperated with the division and intends to continue to do so. while the formal investigation continues, the company has entered into settlement negotiations with the division. however, the settlement process is ongoing and therefore we cannot predict when this investigation will be resolved or what form the eventual outcome will take.it could result in material penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and may require significant time and attention from our management.economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition.at june 30, 2014, bohr and shore were classified as ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù for regulatory capital purposes.however, impairments to our loan or securities portfolio, declines in our earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time. if bohr or shore is unable to remain ‚Äúwell capitalized,‚Äù it will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area. as a result, it would be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered deposits mature and do not rollover and to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. if we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected.in addition, we would be required to pay higher insurance premiums to the fdic, which will reduce our earnings.virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock.our articles of incorporation, as well as the company‚Äôs bylaws (the ‚Äúbylaws‚Äù), contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of the company. these provisions include the ability of our board to set the price, term, and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock. our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. 57table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationsimilarly, the virginia stock corporation act contains provisions designed to protect virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. these provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. these provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of shareholders to change the composition of the board, to affect its policies generally, and to benefit from actions that are opposed by the current board.our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.the management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and to our ability to service our customer base.our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general.in managing our balance sheet, a primary source of funding is customer deposits. our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. our potential inability to maintain adequate sources of funding may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investments or loans, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include operating losses; rising levels of non-performing assets; a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated or as a result of a loss of confidence in us by our customers, lenders, and/or investors; or adverse regulatory action against us.our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry. the availability and level of deposits and other funding sources, including borrowings and the issuance of equity and debt securities, is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution, and such perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company. concerns about our financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity, financial position, regulatory capital ratios, results of operations, and our business prospects.our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.we face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial servicesthat serve our market area.a number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services.many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. as a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. while we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions serving our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions.if we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. failure to compete effectively to attract new, or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, growth, and the market price of our common stock.sales or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.the market price of our common stock could drop if our existing shareholders decide to sell their shares.as of june 30, 2014, anchorage, capgen, and carlyle owned 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock.pursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with these shareholders, the company has an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our common stock by each of the shareholders listed above. if any of these shareholders sell large  58table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationamounts of our common stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly.in addition, sale of our common stock by anchorage, capgen, and carlyle could adversely impact our ability to realize certain deferred tax benefits relating to prior losses, thereby increasing our effective tax rate in the future.the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss.our business strategy centers, in part, on offering real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans secured by real estate in order to generate interest income.these types of loans generally have higher yields due to an elevated risk profile compared to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.at june 30, 2014 real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, and equity line lending (which includes junior lien mortgage loans) totaled $628.8 million, and $124.6 million, respectively. these loan categories combined represented approximately 54.0% of total loans.such loans increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have lower concentrations of real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans.loans secured by real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage properties are generally for larger amounts than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties.accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy.while we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.equity line lending allows a customer to access an amount up to their line of credit for the term specified in their agreement.at the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan.we cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines.while we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses. our loan portfolio contains loans used to finance construction and land development.construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property‚Äôs value at completion of construction, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction.if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project.if the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment.when lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal.although our underwriting criteria were designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to our operations.at june 30, 2014 we had loans of $138.1 million or 9.9% of total loans outstanding to finance construction and land development.construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance, however, in many cases such construction and development projects in our primary market areas are not being completed in a timely manner, if at all.a portion of our residential and real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage lending is secured by vacant or unimproved land.loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally more risky than loans secured by improved property for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. since vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business.these loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 59table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationwith approximately three-fourths of our loans concentrated in the regions of hampton roads, richmond, the eastern shore of virginia, and the research triangle region of north carolina, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans.a decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses.also a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse.the local economies where the company does business are heavily reliant on military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that might result from recent congressional budgetary enactments.real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters.while our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property.we have had large numbers of problem loans, relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so.our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrualloans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 4.19% and 5.29% at june 30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.  on june 30, 2014, less than 1% of our loans was 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets.the administration of non-performing loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our non-performing assets.the determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. we maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management‚Äôs best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans.our allowance for loan losses was $26.1 million at june 30, 2014, which represented 1.91% of our total loans, as compared to $35.0 million, or 2.53% of total loans, at december 31, 2013.the level of the allowance reflects management‚Äôs estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.for further discussion on the impact continued weak economic conditions have on the collateral underlying our loan portfolio, see ‚Äúif the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to further decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.‚Äùthe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.in addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans.such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.furthermore, certain proposed changes to gaap, if implemented as proposed, may require us to increase our estimate for losses embedded in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital.accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance for loan losses may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen.any such increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.our profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.these rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management‚Äôs view of our needs.changes in interest rates will  60table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationaffect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the prices of securities, loans and deposits, and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business, and could result in decreases to our earnings. our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments.this could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.deposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. under current conditions, pricing pressures also may arise from depositors who demand premium interest rates from whatthey perceive to be a troubled financial institution. there is intense competition for deposits. the competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. in addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.furthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize fdic insurance coverage. in addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. it is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. in order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term. finally, we may see interest rate pricing pressure from depositors concerned about our financial condition and levels of non-performing assets.we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams.financial institutions are a prime target of criminal activities through various channels of information technology. we attempt to mitigate risk from such activities through policies, procedures, and preventative and detective measures. in addition, we maintain insurance coverage designed to provide a level of financial protection to our business. however, risks posed by business interruption, fraud losses, business recovery expenses, and other potential losses or expenses that may be experienced from a significant event are not readily predictable and, therefore, could have an impact on our results of operations.our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area.because a substantial portion of our loans are with customers and businesses located in the central and coastal portions of virginia, north carolina, delaware, and maryland, catastrophic events, including natural disasters such as hurricanes which have historically struck the east coast of the united states with some regularity, or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our operations. any of these natural disasters or other catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our financial centers and customer base as well as collateral values and the strength of our loan portfolio. any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the market price of our common stock.the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division (‚Äúdoj‚Äù).although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of the related investigation.on november2, 2010, the company received from the doj a grand jury subpoena to produce information principally relating to the merger of gfh into the company on december31, 2008 and to loans made by gfh and its wholly-owned subsidiary, gateway, before gfh‚Äôs merger with the company. the doj has informed the company that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time, and we are fully cooperating.although we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company, we can give you no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of this investigation.the company is not aware of any recent developments in this matter and has not been notified of any developments in over a year. the company has not had contact with the doj related to the grand jury subpoena since april 2011. 61table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationrisks relating to market, legislative, and regulatory events our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry.the u.s. government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis.in addition to participating in the treasury‚Äôs tarp cpp, the u.s. government has taken steps that include enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, and increasing insured deposits.these programs subject us and other financial institutions who have participated in these programs to additional restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.compliance with such regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.we also will be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.the increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact our results of operations.new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the u.s. congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry.federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.we cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on us.additional regulation could affect us in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors. we are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies.the regulators‚Äô interpretation and application of relevant regulations, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth.in addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into the mou with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before: either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind; the company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.all such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, the use of brokered deposits, and the creation of financial centers.although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors.the regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors.  62table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationthe fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states.its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin.it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities.its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. in addition, as a public company we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations.continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.in addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other requirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on july 21, 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank act into law. the dodd-frank act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. in addition, the law mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action.the dodd-frank act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness for the financial services sector.many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have begun to be or will be implemented over the next few years and will be subject to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies.because the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act will depend on future regulatory rulemaking and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. although management does not expect the dodd-frank act to have a material adverse effect on the company, it is not possible to predict at this time all the effects the dodd-frank act will have on the company and the rest of our industry.it is possible that the company‚Äôs interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital.the full impact of the volcker rule, a component of the dodd-frank act, is yet to be determined.however, should the company have to divest itself of any investments deemed covered funds under the final rule, this may cause the recognition of current unrealized losses and negatively impact current operating results.on june 6, 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules to revise the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee in basel iii.these federal bank regulatory agencies approved final rules on july 2, 2013.the rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500.0 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (‚Äúbanking organizations‚Äù).although the final rules contain significant revisions from the proposed rules intended to provide relief to community banks, such as bohr and shore, many of the basel iii rules will apply to these institutions.among other things, the rules establish a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, changes in the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in the calculation of regulatory capital, and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property.the rules also limit a banking organization‚Äôs capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.for community banking organizations, the rules will be phased in beginning in 2015 and 2016.the company is diligently assessing the impact of this rule making on our capital and the amount of capital required to support our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 63table of contentshampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationfor further discussion of these issues, see the ‚Äúgovernment supervision and regulation‚Äùsection found in‚Äúpart i, item 1 ‚Äì business‚Äù of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, and incorporated by reference herein.proposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.the cfpb has issued a rule designed to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the dodd-frank act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay a mortgage. loans that meet this definition of ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. under the cfpb‚Äôs rule, a ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù loan must not contain certain specified features, including:excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less ‚Äúbona fide discount points‚Äù for prime loans);interest-only payments;negative-amortization; andterms longer than 30 years.also, to qualify as a ‚Äúqualified mortgage,‚Äù a borrower‚Äôs total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. the cfpb‚Äôs rule on qualified mortgages and similar rules could limit our ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and time-consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry, generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.in addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us.there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of, or market for, our common stock. item 2 - unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceedsthe company announced an open ended program on august 13, 2003, by which management was authorized to repurchase

accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for interim financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-q.accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements.in the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation.the results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.the company has two banking subsidiaries, bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù, collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù). for further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the company‚Äôs annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013 (‚Äú2013 form 10-k‚Äù). use of estimates in the preparation of financial statementsthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) requires management to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.actual results could differ from those estimates. material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, determination of fair value for financial instruments, and tax assets, liabilities, and expenses.recent accounting pronouncementsin july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, income taxes, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented, with some exceptions, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.this update is effective for years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15, 2013.early adoption is permitted.the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.in february 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-02, reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.this update requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts.this update was required to be applied prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2012.the adoption of the new guidance resulted in additional disclosures within the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.in january 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-01, clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities that clarifies the intended scope of the disclosures required by asu 2011-11, disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities that facilitates comparison between gaap and international financial reporting standards by requiring companies to provide enhanced disclosures for financial instruments and derivative instruments to enable users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements.this update was required to be applied retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.the

matters effective june 9, 2010, the company and its banking subsidiary, bohr, entered into a written agreement (herein called the ‚Äúwritten agreement‚Äù) with the federal reserve bank of richmond (‚Äúfrb‚Äù) and the bureau of financial institutions of the virginia state corporation commission (‚Äúbureau of financial institutions‚Äù or ‚Äùbfi‚Äù).the written agreement was terminated on february 20, 2014 and the company and bohr are no longer subject to its terms and conditions.shore was not subject to the written agreement.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into a memorandum of understanding (the ‚Äúmou‚Äù) with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before, (i) either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind; (ii) the company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; (iii) the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or (iv) the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.on april 14, 2014, the united states department of the treasury (‚Äútreasury‚Äù) sold its common stock, which it acquired through the company‚Äôs participation in the capital purchase program (‚Äúcpp‚Äù) of the treasury‚Äôs troubled asset relief program (‚Äútarp‚Äù). as a result of participation in tarp, our executives and certain of our employees were subject to compensation related limitations and restrictions, which applied so long as the treasury held the common stock it received in return for the financial assistance it provided us (disregarding any warrants to purchase our common stock that the treasury may hold). therefore, the compensation related limitations and restrictions will not apply to compensation earned after the treasury‚Äôs sale. in connection with the treasury‚Äôs sale, the company agreed to cancel certain restricted stock units that became non-payable under the treasury‚Äôs tarp regulations at the time of sale.note c - earnings per sharethe following table shows the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations for the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013.(in thousands, except share

securities, forty-five mortgage-backed agency securities, six mortgage-backed non-agency securities, and thirteen asset-backed securities. the severity and duration of unrealized losses is expected to fluctuate with market interest rates.other-than-temporary impairment (‚Äúotti‚Äù)during the three months ended march 31, 2014and 2013, no securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and no impairment losses were recognized through noninterest income.management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.in determining otti, management considers many factors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.the assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.when otti occurs, the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis,  11hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsless any current period credit loss.if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss, the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment‚Äôs amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.maturities of investment securitiesthe amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity of investment securities available for sale that are not determined to be other-than-temporarily

at cost as there is no active market or exchange for the stock other than the fhlb or member institutions.therefore, when evaluating fhlb stock for impairment, its value is based on ultimate

financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying assets.the company originated residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and (from september 2012 to december 2013) on a mandatory delivery basis.in connection with the underwriting process, the company enters into commitments to lock-in the interest rate of the loan with the borrower prior to funding (‚Äúinterest rate lock commitments‚Äù).generally, such interest rate lock commitments are for periods less than 60 days.these interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives.the company manages its exposure to changes in fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments by entering into simultaneous agreements to sell the residential loans to third party investors shortly after their origination and funding.at march 31, 2014 and at december 31, 2013 the company had loans held for sale of $20.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively. 25hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsunder the contractual relationship in the best efforts method, the company is obligated to sell the loans only if the loans close. as a result of the terms of these contractual relationships, the company is not exposed tochanges in fair value nor will it realize gains related to its rate-lock commitments due to subsequent changes in interest rates.at march 31, 2014 and at december 31, 2013, the company had rate-lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans (unfunded par amount of loans) on a best efforts basis in the amounts of $49.8 million and $35.6 million, respectively. from september 2012to december 2013, the company sold some of its mortgage loan production on a mandatory delivery basis and using derivative instruments (essentially forward delivery commitments and to-be-announced securities) to manage the resulting interest rate risk.these derivatives were entered into as balance sheet risk management instruments, and therefore, were not designated as an accounting hedge.under the mandatory delivery approach, residential mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates exposed the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment until the loans are delivered to the investor.also, the decrease in the carrying value of the underlying loans and interest rate lock commitments totaled $247 thousand. gains and losses on the company‚Äôs derivative instruments are included within mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. additionally, to meet the needs of its commercial customers, the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.derivative contracts are executed between the company and certain commercial loan customers with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program enabling the commercial loan customers to effectively exchange variable-rate interest payments under their existing obligations for fixed-rate interest payments.for the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013, the company recorded a gain totaling $79 thousand and $203 thousand, respectively, related to trading income on the interest rate swaps included in the back-to-back swap program that was included within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.note j - fair value measurementsfair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.the company classifies financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.valuation methodologies for the fair value hierarchy are as follows.level 1 ‚Äì quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.level 2 ‚Äì observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose values are determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. level 3 ‚Äì unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.level 3 assets and liabilities include values that are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. the categorization of an asset or liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.recurring basisthe company measures or monitors certain of its assets on a fair value basis.fair value is used on a recurring basis for those assets and liabilities for which an election was made as well as for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. 26hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated

or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. the following describes the valuation techniques used to estimate fair value for our assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis.investment securities available for sale.where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products, and exchange traded equities.if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.level 2 securities would include u.s. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed, and other securities valued using third party quoted prices in markets that are not active.in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. derivative loan commitments.the company originates mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market on both a best efforts and a mandatory delivery basis.under the best efforts basis, the company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate is fixed prior to funding.these commitments, in which the company intends to sell in the secondary market, are considered freestanding derivatives.under the mandatory delivery basis, mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to borrowers to originate loans at agreed upon interest rates expose the company to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock commitment.the fair values of interest rate lock and mandatory delivery commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as level 3, are based on quoted prices adjusted for commitments that the company does not expect to fund.interest rate swaps. the company uses observable inputs to determine fair value of its interest rate swaps.the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques that are based on discounted cash flow analysis using the expected cash flows of each derivative over the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and market-based interest rate curves.the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments.the variable cash payments were based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.accordingly, the company categorizes these financial instruments within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.nonrecurring basiscertain assets, specifically collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an  28hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementsongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment and an allowance is established to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value).the adjustments are based on appraisals of underlying collateral or other observable market prices when current appraisals or observable market prices are available.where we do not have an appraisal that is less than 12 months old, an existing appraisal or other valuation would be utilized after discounting it to reflect current market conditions, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. to assist in the discounting process, a valuation matrix was developed to provide valuation guidance for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned where it was deemed that an existing appraisal was outdated as to current market conditions.the matrix applies discounts to external appraisals depending on the type of real estate and age of the appraisal.the discounts are generally specific point estimates; however in some cases, the matrix allows for a small range of values.the discounts were based in part upon externally derived statistical data.the discounts were also based upon management‚Äôs knowledge of market conditions and prices of sales of other real estate owned.in addition, matrix value adjustments may be made by our independent appraisal group to reflect property value trends within specific markets as well as actual sales data from market transactions and/or foreclosed real estate sales.it is the company‚Äôs policy to classify these as level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy.the weighted average age of appraisals for valuations of collateral dependent impaired loans was 0.63 years as of march 31, 2014.management periodically reviews the discounts in the matrix as compared to valuations from updated appraisals and modifies the discounts accordingly should updated appraisals reflect valuations significantly different than those derived utilizing the matrix.to date, management believes the appraisal discount matrix has resulted in appropriate adjustments to existing appraisals thereby providing management with reasonable valuations for the collateral underlying the loan portfolio; however, while appraisals are indicators of fair value, the amount realized upon sale of these assets could be significantly different. the following tables reflect the fair value of assets measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. assetsfair value measurements

considered collateral dependent. for collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.other real estate owned and repossessed assets.the adjustments to other real estate owned and repossessed assets are based primarily on appraisals of the real estate or other observable market prices.our policy is that fair values for these assets are based on current appraisals.in most cases, we maintain current appraisals for these items.where we do not have a current appraisal, an existing appraisal would be utilized after discounting it to reflect  29hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statementschanges in market conditions from the date of the existing appraisal, and, as such, may include significant management assumptions and input with respect to the determination of fair value. branch consolidation. on march 27, 2013, the company announced the consolidation of seven bohr and shore branch locations, six owned and one leased, into nearby branches.this required an impairment analysis to be performed.in connection with the analysis, five of the branch locations were determined to have carrying amounts that exceeded fair value at march 31, 2013.accordingly, the related carrying amounts of these branches were reduced to estimated fair value (less costs to sell) and the company recorded an impairment totaling $2.8 million during the quarter ended march 31, 2013.management estimated the fair value of the branches by utilizing various market-based valuation techniques, including estimates from unrelated brokers, existing purchase offers from unrelated parties, and appraisals available as of the measurement date.approximately $3.4 million related to the remaining carrying values of the branch related assets was transferred into other real estate owned in accordance with relevant accounting guidance and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.significant unobservable inputsthe following table presents the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the company‚Äôs material level 3 assets; these

reflect current marketconditions, abbreviated holdingperiod, and estimated costs to sellother fair value measurementsadditionally, accounting standards require the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value. for the financial instruments that the company does not record at fair value, estimates of fair value are made at a point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument.no readily available market exists for a significant portion of the company‚Äôs financial instruments.fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, interest rate risk characteristics, and other factors. many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument.in addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates.the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating fair value of these financial instruments. (a) cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(b)investment securities available for salefair values are based on published market prices where available. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow.investment securities available for sale are carried at their aggregate fair value. 30hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 1.notes to consolidated financial statements (c)restricted equity securitiesthese investments are carried at cost.the carrying amount approximates fair value.(d)loans held for salethe carrying value of loans held for sale is a reasonable estimate of fair value since loans held for sale are expected to be sold within a short period. (e)loansto determine the fair values of loans other than those listed as nonaccrual, we use discounted cash flow analyses.in these analyses, we use discount rates that are similar to the interest rates and terms currently being offered to borrowers of similar terms and credit quality.for nonaccrual loans, we use a variety of techniques to measure fair value, such as using the current appraised value of the collateral, discounting the contractual cash flows, and analyzing market data that we may adjust due to the specific characteristics of the loan or collateral.(f)interest receivable and interest payablethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(g)bank-owned life insurancethe carrying amount approximates fair value.(h)depositsthe fair values disclosed for transaction deposits such as demand and savings accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (this is, their carrying values).the carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date.fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on comparable instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.(i)borrowingsthe fair value of borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.these include fhlb borrowings and other borrowings. (j)commitments to extend credit and standby letters of creditthe only amounts recorded for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are the deferred fees arising from these unrecognized financial instruments.these deferred fees are not deemed significant at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and as such, the related fair values have not been estimated.the carrying amounts and fair values of those financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 were as follows.march 31, 2014carryingfairfair value measurements at

the forward-looking statements.they are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments, or results, you should carefully review the risk factors summarized below and the more detailed discussion in the ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù section of this report.our risks include, without limitation, the following:our success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members;we are not paying dividends on our common stock and currently are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;we have elected to defer payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company and we expect to continue to defer the payment of interest until we receive approval to pay the deferred interest;the volcker rule collateralized loan obligation provisions could result in adverse consequences for us, including lower earnings, lower tangible capital and/or lower regulatory capital;we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the three months ended march 31, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels;our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations;the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements;economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition;virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock; our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations;our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry; sales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price;the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss;if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;we have had large numbers of problem loans relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so; 33hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionthe determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected;our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk;we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability;we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams;our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area;the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division.although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of the related investigation;our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities;banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors; the fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;proposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans and/or attract certain types of deposits; and the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.our forward-looking statements could be incorrect in light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.the future events, developments, or results described in this report could turn out to be materially different.we have no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements after the date of this report and you should not expect us to do so.critical accounting policiesu.s. generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting, and disclosure matters. management must use assumptions, judgments, and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex assumptions, judgments, and estimates.our assumptions, judgments, and estimates may be incorrect, and changes in such assumptions, judgments, and estimates may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.actual results, in fact, could differ materially from those estimates.we consider our policies on allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred taxes, and the valuation of other real estate owned to be critical accounting policies.refer to our 2013 form 10-k for further discussion of these policies.material trends and uncertaintiesgeneral economic conditions in our major markets continue on a path of slow recovery. according to a recent bureau of labor statistics report, it was estimated that the hampton roads region lost 4,000 jobs between december 2013 and january 2014, resulting in the largest decline since april 2009. additionally, this employment report included the annual "benchmark revision," which revealed that regional employment in december 2013 was actually 10,400 less than previously estimated, meaning that the hampton roads region started the first quarter of 2014 with 14,400 fewer jobs than originally reported at the end of 2013.the impact caused the regional unemployment rate to be at 5.7% in march 2014, compared to the 5.3% unemployment rate in december 2013.during the first quarter of 2014, we have experienced soft overall loan growth, with originations not keeping pace with normal loan pay downs and charge offs, resulting in our balance of gross loans declining since december 31, 2013. based on recent reports, the federal reserve‚Äôs intention is to continue to maintain a low interest rate environment at least into 2015.this will certainly continue to place downward pressure on our net interest income  34hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionand our overall operating net income.due to the continued improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio, non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets improved during the first three months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. the elevation of mortgage interest rates which began in late summer 2013, has caused a dramatic decline in refinancing activity, and will continue to put downward pressure on overall mortgage banking revenue. due to cost reduction initiatives implemented over the last few years, noninterest expense has declined improving our overall efficiency.for further discussion of the material trends and uncertainties that may affect our results and financial condition, refer to the risk factors contained part ii item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù in this report.company overviewhampton roads bankshares, inc. (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in virginia beach, virginia.the company‚Äôs primary subsidiaries are bank of hampton roads (‚Äúbohr‚Äù) and shore bank (‚Äúshore‚Äù collectively the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù).the banks engage in general community and commercial banking business, targeting the needs of individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in our primary service areas.currently, bohr operates 17 full-service offices in the hampton roads region of southeastern virginia and 10 full-service offices throughout richmond, virginia and the northeastern and research triangle regions of north carolina that do business as gateway bank & trust co. (‚Äúgateway‚Äù).shore operates 6 full-service offices in the eastern shore of virginia and maryland.through various affiliates, the banks also offer mortgage banking and investment services.our largest investor shareholders include anchorage capital group, l.l.c. (‚Äúanchorage‚Äù), capgen capital group vi lp (‚Äúcapgen‚Äù), and the carlyle group, l.p. (‚Äúcarlyle‚Äù).anchorage, capgen, and carlyle own 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march 31, 2014. our primary source of revenue is net interest income earned by our bank subsidiaries.net interest income represents interest and fees earned from lending and investment activities less the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.net interest income may be impacted by variations in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the yields earned and the rates paid, level of non-performing assets, and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support earning assets.in addition to net interest income, noninterest income is another important source of revenue.noninterest income is derived primarily from service charges on deposits and mortgage banking revenue.gains and losses on the sale or impairment of our other real estate owned and repossessed assets are recognized in noninterest income.other significant factors that impact net income (loss) attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. are the provision for loan losses, and noninterest expense.the direct lending activities in which the company engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. as such, interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve") and general economic conditions, nationally and in the company's primary market areas, have a significant impact on the company's results of operations. to the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the company in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the company. regarding net interest margin, the company makes fixed rate loans, whereby general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce the company's spread as the interest rates the company must pay for deposits may increase while interest income may be unchanged. economic conditions may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans and the ability to liquidate that property to satisfy a loan if necessary.the company's goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures and modifying those policies on occasion to account for changing or emerging risks or changing market conditions, evaluating each borrower's business plan and financial condition during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and maintaining sufficient collateral to mitigate economic loss in the event of liquidation. an allowance for loan losses has been established which consists of general, specific, and unallocated components. a risk rating system is employed to estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general reserve allocations.the general component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for specific impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated for potential loss.the specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment.the specific allowance for loan losses is based on a loan-by-loan analysis and varies between impaired loans largely due to the  35hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditionvalue of the loan‚Äôs underlying collateral.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses and considers internal portfolio management effectiveness and external macroeconomic factors.overviewthe following commentary provides information about the major components of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources.this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan delinquencies and defaults that we experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.the company reported net income for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as it did for the year ended december 31, 2013.the improvement, compared to the net operating losses for 2009 to 2012, primarily resulted from improved general economic conditions and credit performance of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio. there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which increased in 2013, resulting in significantly lower revenue in our mortgage segment. the company also recognized $3.2 million in income from bank-owned life insurance for the quarter ended march 31, 2014, which is significantly higher than the company‚Äôs historic or expected bank-owned life insurance income.as of march 31, 2014, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.the following is a summary of our financial condition as of march 31, 2014 and our financial performance for the three months then ended.assets were $1.9 billion at march 31, 2014.total assets decreased by $4.7 million or 0.2% from december 31, 2013.the decrease in assets was primarily associated with a $4.5 million or 18.1% decrease in loans held for sale, a $34.8 million or 2.5% decrease in gross loans, a $9.0 million or 24.7% decrease in other real estate owned and foreclosed real estate, a $7.1 million or 2.2% decrease in investment securities available for sale, partially offset by $47.0 million or 109.8% increase in overnight funds sold and due from frb, and a $4.2 million or 43.0% increase in other assets.investment securities available for sale decreased $7.1 million or 2.2% to $318.4 million as of march 31, 2014 from $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.the decrease primarily resulted from maturities, calls, and sales of our mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities, offset by an increase in the net unrealized gains in our total portfolio and purchases of mortgage-backed securities.gross loans decreased by $34.8 million or 2.5% during the three months ended march 31, 2014, primarily due to normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume.impaired loans increased by $3.3 million during the three months ended march 31, 2014 to $70.9 million at march 31, 2014, up from $67.6 million at december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of three credit relationships that became impaired and subsequently designated as nonperforming loans during the quarter.based on current projections, management expects impaired loans to resume a downward trend for the second quarter of 2014.allowance for loan losses at march 31, 2014 decreased 10.8% to $31.3 million from $35.0 million at december 31, 2013 as net charge-offs exceeded additional provisions for loan losses.deposits at march 31, 2014 decreased $5.4 million or 0.4% from december 31, 2013 as a result of decreases of $4.5 million or 1.5% in time deposits over $100 thousand, decreases of $3.7 million or 1.5% in non-interest bearing demand deposits, decreases of $3.4 million or 5.5% in savings deposits, partially offset by increases of $5.4 million in interest-bearing demand deposits.the decline in time deposits is primarily  36hampton roads

compared with net income of $632 thousand for the same period in 2013.net interest income decreased $975 thousand in the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. the decrease was due primarily to the decreases in average interest-earning assets, and a slight decline in net interest margin.as a result of net charge-off volume and newly impaired loans, the impact of which was predominantly offset by a reduction in loans outstanding and a lower required pooled (general) and unallocated component of the loan loss allowance, a loan loss provision of $100 thousand was required during the first quarter of 2014.noninterest income for the three months ended march 31, 2014 was $7.3 million, a 34.5% increase over the same period in 2013. this increase was largely due to a decline in losses on premises and equipment associated with certain branch closings in the prior year; a decline in losses on other real estate owned and repossessed assets; and an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance.offsetting these improvements was the continued decline in mortgage banking revenue which decreased $4.2 million or 69.6% during the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to declines in both origination volume and margin, driven by rising market interest rates which had dramatic negative impact on refinance demand.income from bank-owned life insurance increased $2.8 million during for the three months ended march 31, 2014 to $3.2 million compared to $373 thousand for the first three months of 2013.the increase was due to life insurance benefits received in excess of cash surrender value from the deaths of one current employee and one former employee.noninterest expense during the three months ended march 31, 2014 declined 4.7% compared to the same period in 2013, finishing at $18.5 million, primarily due to lower salary and employee benefits.our effective tax rate was 0.2% for the three months ended march 31,

attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three months ended march 31, 2014 was $3.9 million, as compared with net income of $632 thousand for the same period in 2013.net interest income and net interest marginnet interest income, a major component of our earnings, is the difference between the income generated by interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.net interest margin, which is calculated by expressing annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, is an indicator of effectiveness in generating income from earning assets. net interest income and net interest margin may be significantly impacted by the market interest rates (rate); the mix, duration, and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume); changes in the yields earned and rates paid; and the level of noninterest-bearing liabilities available to support interest-earning assets.our management team strives to maximize net interest income through prudent balance sheet administration and by maintaining appropriate risk levels as determined by our asset / liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù) and the

loans, investment and restricted equity securities, overnight funds sold and due from frb, and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.net interest income for the three months ended march 31, 2014 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $975 thousand or 6.0% as compared to the same period in 2013. net interest margin for the three months ended march 31, 2014 was 3.40%, down from 3.45% for the comparable period in 2013.in the current low interest rate environment, the company expects to continue to experience downward pressure on net interest margin, as rates on interest earning assets decline at a faster pace than that of our interest-bearing liabilities.interest income on loans, including fees, decreased $2.0 million to $15.7 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2013.this decrease was predominantly the result of a decline in the average yield on loans from 4.82% in 2013 to 4.62% in 2014, and the decline in average loan balances year over year by $109.5 million.interest income on investment securities increased $419 thousand to $2.2 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2013.this increase was due to a $29.9 million increase in average investment securities, and a 29-basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities to 2.71% in 2014 from 2.42% during 2013.interest income on overnight funds sold and due from frb decreased modestly to $32 thousand for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to $42 thousand for the same period in 2013.this decrease was largely due to the $10.0 million decrease in average overnight funds sold and due from frb and a 3-basis point decrease in the average yield on average overnight funds sold and due from frb.interest-bearing liabilities consist of deposit accounts and borrowings.interest expense on deposits decreased $387 thousand to $2.1 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2013. this decrease resulted from an $88.9 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits and an 8-basis point decrease in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.a reduction in the average rate paid on time deposits to 1.02% for the three months ended march 31, 2014 from 1.09% for the same period in 2013, coupled with a $147.9 million decrease in average time deposits, contributed significantly toward the decrease in overall interest expense on deposits.interest expense on borrowings, which consisted of fhlb borrowings and other borrowings, decreased $210 thousand to $863 thousand for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2013. the 24-basis point decrease in the average interest rate paid on borrowings and the $17.2 million decrease in average borrowings produced this result.in 2011, following a review of the company‚Äôs current level of assumed interest rate risk and to promote liquidity and enhance current earnings, the company modified certain advances with the fhlb. a majority of the company‚Äôs existing fixed-rate advances were restructured as floating rate obligations at a fixed spread to three month libor with maturities ranging from 2.75 to 4 years. noninterest incomefor the three months ended march 31, 2014 total noninterest income was $7.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 34.5% as compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2013. noninterest income comprised 28.9% of total revenue in the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 21.7% for the same period in 2013.we define total revenue as the sum of interest income and non-interest income. this increase was largely due to a decline in losses on premises and equipment; a decline in losses on other real estate owned and repossessed assets, and an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenue. 39hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of

by implementation costs and operating expenses associated with the company‚Äôs additional products and services.in addition, during 2013, approximately $5.0 million of depreciable equipment was reclassified from furniture and fixtures to data processing hardware asset category.these asset transfers caused an increase in depreciation expense year over year in the data processing expense category. and finally, a vendor credit was received in 2013 that reduced expenses; however, a similar credit was not received in 2014.professional and consultant fees increased due to a number of factors, including legal and professional costs related to the launch of new products and services, legal costs related to sec and treasury matters, and legal costs related to settlement of disputesin

primarily associated with a $4.5 million or 18.1% decrease in loans held for sale, a $34.8 million or 2.5% decrease in gross loans, a $9.0 million or 24.7% decrease in other real estate owned and foreclosed real estate, a $7.1 million or 2.2% decrease in investment securities available for sale, partially offset by $47.0 million or 109.8% increase in overnight funds sold and due from frb, and a $4.2 million or 43.0% increase in other assets.this increase in other assets is mainly attributed to bank owned life insurance proceeds due to the company.cash and cash equivalents.cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and overnight funds sold and due from frb.cash and cash equivalents are used for daily cash management purposes, management of short-term interest rate opportunities, and liquidity.cash and cash equivalents as of march 31, 2014 were $108.1 million compared to $62.3 million at december 31, 2013 and consisted mainly of deposits with frb.primarily due to normal loan pay down and charge off activity which exceeded new loan origination volume, the company experienced an increase in the overall level of cash and cash equivalents.in the future, the company expects to utilize its cash on hand to support future loan origination activity.investment securities. our investment portfolio at march 31, 2014 consisted primarily of u.s. agency, mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities.the allocation to asset-backed securities, which began in 2013, provides the company with a floating rate asset, which mitigates the interest rate risk inherent in certain other asset classes, e.g., mortgage backed securities (‚Äúmbs‚Äù).repayment of principal and interest of the abs security is dependent upon

reported at fair value and are used primarily for liquidity, pledging, earnings, and asset / liability management purposes and are reviewed quarterly for possible impairment.at march 31, 2014 the fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities declined $7.1 million or 2.2% to $318.4 million compared to $325.5 million at december 31, 2013.it was determined that none of this decline in fair value was attributable to other than temporary impairment.loans. as a holding company of two community banks, we have a primary objective of meeting the business and consumer credit needs within our markets where standards of profitability, client relationships, and credit quality intersect.our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, construction, real estate-commercial mortgage, real estate-residential mortgage, and installment loans.lending decisions are based upon evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan.personal guarantees are required on most loans; however, prudent exceptions are made on occasion based upon the financial viability of the borrowing entity or the underlying project that is being financed.overall our loan trends during the three months ended march 31, 2014 have been influenced by decreased demand for loans in nearly all our loan categories.our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased $19.4 million to the march 31, 2014 balance of $206.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $225.5 million.construction loans decreased $9.4 million to the march 31, 2014 balance of $149.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $158.5 million.our real estate-commercial mortgage loan portfolio decreased $2.0 million to the march 31, 2014 balance of $588.5 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $590.5 million.the real estate-residential mortgage loan portfolio showed a minor increase to the $355.1 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $354.0 million. the installment loan portfolio decreased $5.2 million to the march 31, 2014 balance of $52.4 million from the december 31, 2013 balance of $57.6 million.in addition to the aforementioned weaker demand for credit, the contraction seen in loans stems from the continued resolution of problem loans.origination volumes were also offset by principal pay-downs and scheduled amortization in the portfolio.in the future, our continued focus will be on managing the entire loan portfolio through the ongoing challenging economic conditions.additionally, our prudent business practices and internal guidelines and underwriting standards will continue to be followed in making lending decisions in order to manage exposure to credit-related losses.allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.the allowance for loan losses was $31.3 million or 2.32% of outstanding loans as of march 31, 2014 compared with $35.0 million or 2.53% of outstanding loans as of december 31, 2013.the allowance for loan losses decreased $3.8 million (net of charge-offs and recoveries) during the three months ended march 31, 2014 as a result of net charge-offs exceeding additional provisions for loan losses.net charge-offs were $3.9 million during the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared with $4.7 million during the same period in 2013.our provision for loan losses was $100 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to no provision for loan losses being recorded during the same period in 2013. we did not change our methodology or model for estimating the allowance for loan losses during any of the past three years. 42hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of

loans70.6687.90the specific component of our allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, are individually evaluated for impairment.the specific component decreased during the three months ended march 31, 2014, primarily due to the charge-off of loans with specific reserves.specific loan loss allocations decreased $1.4 million to $11.7 million at march 31, 2014 from $13.1 million at december 31, 2013.the general or pooled component relates to groups of homogeneous loans not designated for a specific allowance and are collectively evaluated for impairment.the pooled component of the allowance decreased $2.0 million during the three months ended march 31, 2014, from $17.6 million at december 31, 2013 to $15.6 million at march 31, 2014. the decrease in the pooled component is the result of (i) lower historical loss factors applied in our models, as higher charge-offs in older periods are replaced with lower charge-offs in more recent periods, (ii) changes in portfolio mix, as categories with higher pooled reserve levels such as construction loans have continued to decline, and (iii) continued improvement in credit quality as evidenced by improved internal weighted average loan grades.an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management‚Äôs estimate of probable losses.the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance decreased $357 thousand to $3.9 million at march 31, 2014, due to a combination of factors, compared to $4.3 million at december 31, 2013.macroeconomic indicators such as gdp, unemployment, and housing prices trended negatively during the first quarter of 2014, resulting in an increase in the portion of the unallocated component that considers external variables.however, the portion of the unallocated component that considers internal variables declined as a reflection of management‚Äôs assessment of the improved health of the portfolio and the credit processes of the company. additionally, the continued resolution of troubled assets led to a reduction in the overall size of the loan portfolio and an improvement in the quality of the existing portfolio.  43hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 2.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditiontable 5 displays certain

provided35.8239.94at march 31, 2014, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses to be commensurate with the risk existing in our portfolio.however, the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies.such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examinations. notwithstanding these allocations, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge-offs in any loan category.non-performing assets. management classifies non-performing assets as those loans on which payments have been delinquent 90 days and are still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, and foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets.our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 5.16% and 5.29% at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 we had loans totaling $298 thousand and $0, respectively, categorized as 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.loans in non-accrual status totaled $44.2 million and $39.9 million at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.loans are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, part of the balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans reach 90 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless there are extenuating circumstances. we had $27.6 million and $36.7 million of other real estate owned and repossessed assets at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.this decline was mainly due to sales of real estate owned outpacing inflows. deposits. total deposits at march 31, 2014 were $1.5 billion, a decrease of $5.4 million or 0.4% from the $1.5 billion at december 31, 2013.in recent years, our deposit composition has improved as a result of strategies to grow demand deposits, while de-emphasizing higher rate and non-core certificates of deposit. at march 31, 2014, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $241.8 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from $245.4 million at december 31, 2013. interest-bearing demand deposits at march 31, 2014 were $605.7 million, an increase of $5.4 million from $600.3 million at december 31, 2013.interest-bearing demand deposits included $7.5

of brokered cds outstanding at december 31, 2013.the decrease in total time deposits was primarily due to run-off as maturity dates were reached and cds were not renewed due to lower rates offered, particularly in the national market time deposit category.the company continues to focus on core deposit growth as its primary source of funding.core deposits are non-brokered and consist of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and time deposits of less than $100 thousand.core deposits remained unchanged at march 31, 2014 totaling $1.2 billion or 80.0% of total deposits compared to december 31, 2013.borrowings. we use short-term and long-term borrowings from various sources including the frb discount window, fhlb, and trust preferred securities.we manage the level of our borrowings to ensure that we have adequate sources of liquidity.refer to our 2013 form 10-k for further discussion about our borrowings.liquidity. liquidity represents an institution‚Äôs ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management.it is used by management to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds.we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during the three months ended march 31, 2014. at march 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $108.1 million and investment securities available for sale at fair value were $318.4 million. at march 31, 2014, our banks had credit lines in the amount of $227.6 million at the fhlb with advances of $189.0 million utilized.these lines may be utilized for short- and/or long-term borrowing.at march 31, 2014, all our fhlb borrowings were long-term.we also possess additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements.the banks also maintain federal funds lines with two regional banking institutions and through the frb discount window.these available lines totaled approximately $38.1 million at march 31, 2014 and none of these lines were utilized for borrowing purposes at march 31, 2014.capital resources. total shareholders‚Äô equity increased $6.0 million or 3.2% from december 31, 2014 to $189.8 million at march 31, 2014. the company and the banks are subject to regulatory capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures to ensure capital adequacy.tier i capital is comprised of shareholders‚Äô equity, net of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, less intangible assets, while total risk-based capital adds certain debt instruments and qualifying allowances for loan losses.as of march 31, 2014, our consolidated regulatory capital ratios were tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.18%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.72%, and total risk-based capital of 15.98%.as of march 31, 2014, the company exceeded the regulatory capital minimums, and bohr and shore were considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù under the risk-based capital standards.their tier 1 leverage ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were as follows: 10.01%, 13.08%, and 14.34%, respectively for bohr and 10.42%, 14.40%, and 15.65%, respectively for shore.contractual obligations. we have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements.additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties.our contractual obligations consist of time deposits, borrowings, and operating lease obligations.off-balance sheet

3.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate sensitivity market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the company.fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the fair value of the company‚Äôs interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.the primary goal of our asset/liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment.our ability to manage our interest rate risk depends generally on our ability to match the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income.our management, guided by alco, determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.these decisions are based on management‚Äôs expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.the primary method that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets and liabilities over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures.this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon.key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments.the table below illustrates the expected effect on net interest income for the twelve months following march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 due to an immediate change in interest rates.estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions, such as those previously discussed.effect on net interest incomemarch 31, 2014december 31, 2013change in net interest incomechange in net interest income(in thousands, except for percentages)amount%amount%change in interest rates:+200 basis

income in an increasing rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a decreasing interest rate environment. as of december 31, 2013, we projected a decrease in net interest income in both increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. dependent upon timing and shifts in the interest rate term structure, certain rising rate scenarios are less favorable due to lower levels of assets with short-term re-pricing characteristics, as well as due to the variable rate structure on the majority of our borrowings and the floors on many loans that will cause a delay in any interest income improvement. it should be noted, however, that the simulation analysis is based upon equivalent changes in interest rates for all categories of assets and liabilities.in normal operating conditions, interest rate changes rarely occur in such a uniform manner.many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments.in addition, management may deploy strategies that offset some of the impact of changes in interest rates.consequently, variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis.management maintains a simulation model where it is assumed that interest rate changes occur gradually, that rate increases for interest-bearing liabilities lag behind the rate increases of interest-earning assets, and that the level of deposit rate increases will be less than the level of rate increases for interest-earning assets.  47hampton roads bankshares, inc.part i.financial informationitem 4.controls and proceduresas of march 31, 2014, the company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief

that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. in addition, no change in its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act) occurred during the three months ended march 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 48hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationitem 1 - legal proceedingsin the ordinary course of operations, the company may become a party to legal proceedings.based upon information currently available, management believes that such legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations except as provided below.in april 2011, the sec informed the company that it is conducting a formal investigation related to certain accounting matters.for a further discussion of this matter, see section ‚Äúrisk factors ‚Äì risks relating to our business ‚Äì the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.‚Äùon november 2, 2010, the company received a grand

grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division.although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or the eventual outcome of the related investigation.‚Äùon november 6, 2013, the company received a notice of violation and intent to seek civil money penalty from the u.s. department of housing and urban development (‚Äúhud‚Äù) stating that hud is considering taking administrative action against and imposing civil money penalties on gateway mortgage for certain asserted violations of hud and federal housing administration requirements. the company and hud have negotiated the terms of a settlement agreement regarding this matter, under which the company would agree to pay $98,500 in civil penalties and provide indemnification for four specific loans, totaling approximately $748,000, for a period of five years from endorsement.the company currently expects that it will enter into a fully executed settlement agreement with hud during the second quarter of 2014 and that such a settlement agreement will have no admission of wrongdoing, and no material impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.item 1a ‚Äì risk factorsfor information regarding factors that could affect the company‚Äôs results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in the company‚Äôs 2013 form 10-k, part i, item 1a ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù.except as and to the extent disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the 2013 form 10-k.risks relating to our businessour success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members.we are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. while we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.we are not paying dividends on our common stock and currently are prevented from doing so.the failure to resume paying dividends on our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.we paid cash dividends on our common stock prior to the third quarter of 2009.during the third quarter of 2009, we suspended dividend payments.we are prevented by our regulators from paying dividends until our financial position improves and, even once our financial condition improves, so long as we are subject to the mou we will need the prior consent of the frb and the bfi before the company may pay any dividend.bohr is subject to the same mou restriction on paying dividends to us. in addition, the retained deficit of bohr, our principal banking subsidiary, was $463.7 million as of march 31, 2014. absent permission from the virginia state corporation commission, bohr may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings.it is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay dividends if bohr cannot pay dividends to us.  49hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationalthough we can seek to obtain a waiver of this prohibition and consent under the mou, our regulators may choose not to grant such a waiver and consent, and we would not expect to be granted a waiver or consent, or to be released from these obligations, until our financial performance and retained earnings improve significantly.as a result, there is no assurance if or when we will be able to resume paying cash dividends. in addition, all dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and are dependent upon our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to our banking subsidiaries.if we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we are unable to pay dividends on our common stock. we have elected to defer the payment of interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of our holding company and expect to continue to defer the payment of interest until we receive approval to pay the deferred interest.beginning in january 2010, we exercised our right to defer all quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities.our deferral of interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters (through various dates during the first quarter of 2015 depending on the series of debt securities) does not constitute an event of default.during the deferral period, the debt securities continue to accrue interest. to the extent applicable law permits interest on interest, the deferred interest payments also accrue interest at the rates specified in the corresponding indentures, compounded quarterly. at march 31, 2014 total accrued interest equaled $5.9 million. all of the deferred interest, including compounded interest, as to each series of debt securities is due in full at the end of the applicable deferral period. if we fail to pay the deferred and compounded interest at the end of the deferral period, the trustee of the corresponding trust, or in most cases the holders of as little as 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of preferred securities, would have the right, after any applicable grace period, to exercise various remedies, including demanding immediate payment in full of the entire outstanding principal amount of such series of debt securities.the aggregate principal amount of all such series of debt securities is $56.7 million.under the mou we are prevented from making payments on our trust preferred securities without the prior consent of the frb and bfi. the mou also prevents bohr from paying dividends to us without the same consents. additionally, the retained deficit of bohr, our principal banking subsidiary, was $463.7 million as of march 31, 2014.absent permission from the virginia state corporation commission, bohr may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings.it is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay the interest accrued on our outstanding debt securities if bohr cannot pay dividends to us.although we will seek to obtain the required consents and a waiver of the retained earnings prohibition, our regulators may choose not to grant such consents and waiver.if by january 17, 2015 we do not achieve sufficient financial stability and profitability for bohr so that our regulators would grant approval for bohr to pay dividends and for the company to make payments on the trust preferred securities, it is unlikely we will resume the payment of interest on the debt securities. even if bohr is able to resume paying dividends, we cannot be assured that the amount of dividends would be sufficient to pay the entire amount of interest due on the debt securities at the end of the deferral period.the volcker rule collateralized loan obligation provisions could result in adverse consequences for us, including lower earnings, lower tangible capital and/or lower regulatory capitalthe so-called ‚Äúvolcker rule‚Äù provisions of the dodd-frank act restrict the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions, such as the banks, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. the federal reserve adopted final rules implementing the volcker rule in december 2013. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the volcker rule and the final rules adopted thereunder. we own $26.9 million of clo securities with a weighted average yield of 2.34% that are subject to the volcker rule. if we decide to sell or are required to sell these securities, our future net interest income could be adversely impacted if our alternative use for these funds yields a lower rate. while there is a potential for additional regulatory guidance or a legislative ruling that would enable banks to continue to hold clo securities under the volcker rule, to the extent this does not materialize nor do the regulators accept any structural solutions put forth by the financial services industry, we are currently subject to potentially significant price movements in these securities which could adversely impact our tangible capital. for instance, a hypothetical 10% reduction in current clo market prices would result in a $5.0 million reduction to our current  50hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationclo securities valuation. since these securities are currently held as available for sale, the resulting change in other comprehensive income (loss) would be approximately $5.0 million. further, if we decide to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell such securities before recovery, we may recognize losses that could adversely impact our regulatory capital ratios. a loss of $5.0 million would lower regulatory capital by 23 basis points.we incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012.while we returned to profitability in 2013, and continued to be profitable during the three months ended march 31, 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue.an inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels. since 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment.while broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained.consequently, the levels of loan delinquencies and defaults that we have experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.our net income attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the three months ended march 31, 2014 was $3.9 million, and was $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 but our net loss attributable to hampton roads bankshares, inc. for the years ended december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011 was $25.1 million and $97.6 million, respectively.there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. in addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates, which have recently increased.our mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.our mortgage banking earnings are dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors.loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. a significant portion of recent increases in our mortgage banking earnings is due to the recent historically low interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. as the interest rate environment returns to more typical levels, mortgage loan refinancing activity has significantly reduced. loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions.any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities.as a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations.the formal investigation by the sec may result in penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.since april 2011, the sec‚Äôs division of enforcement (the ‚Äúdivision‚Äù) has been conducting a formal investigation into the company‚Äôs deferred tax asset valuation allowances, provision and allowance for loan losses, and other matters contained in its annual and quarterly reports for years 2008 through 2010.the company has fully cooperated with the division and intends to continue to do so. however, the formal investigation continues.at this time, we cannot predict when this investigation will be resolved or what form the eventual outcome will take.it could result in material penalties, sanctions, or a restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and may require significant time and attention from our management.economic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition.at march 31, 2014, bohr and shore were classified as ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù for regulatory capital purposes.however, impairments to our loan or securities portfolio, declines in our earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time. if bohr or shore is unable to remain ‚Äúwell capitalized,‚Äù it will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area. as a result, it would be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered deposits mature and do not rollover  51hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationand to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. if we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected.in addition, we would be required to pay higher insurance premiums to the fdic, which will reduce our earnings.virginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our common stock.our articles of incorporation, as well as the company‚Äôs bylaws (the ‚Äúbylaws‚Äù), contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of the company. these provisions include the ability of our board to set the price, term, and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock. our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for the ability of stockholders to call special meetings.similarly, the virginia stock corporation act contains provisions designed to protect virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. these provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. these provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of shareholders to change the composition of the board, to affect its policies generally, and to benefit from actions that are opposed by the current board.our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.the management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and to our ability to service our customer base.our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general.in managing our balance sheet, a primary source of funding is customer deposits. our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. our potential inability to maintain adequate sources of funding may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investments or loans, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include operating losses; rising levels of non-performing assets; a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated or as a result of a loss of confidence in us by our customers, lenders, and/or investors; or adverse regulatory action against us.our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry. the availability and level of deposits and other funding sources, including borrowings and the issuance of equity and debt securities, is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution, and such perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company. concerns about our financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity, financial position, regulatory capital ratios, results of operations, and our business prospects.our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.we face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial servicesthat serve our market area.a number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services.many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. as a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. while we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions serving our primary  52hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationmarkets, we may face a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions.if we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. failure to compete effectively to attract new, or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, growth, and the market price of our common stock.sales or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.the market price of our common stock could drop if our existing shareholders decide to sell their shares.as of march 31, 2014, anchorage, capgen, and carlyle owned 24.90%, 29.97%, and 24.90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock.pursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with these shareholders, the company has an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our common stock by each of the shareholders listed above. in connection with the sale of our common stock by the treasury, anchorage, capgen, carlyle agreed, for 90 days from april 8, 2014 (subject to extension in certain circumstances), that they will not sell shares of our common stock. however, at the end of that period these shareholders could utilize this registration statement to sell their shares. if any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly.in addition, sale of our common stock by anchorage, capgen, and carlyle could adversely impact our ability to realize certain deferred tax benefits relating to prior losses, thereby increasing our effective tax rate in the future.the concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss.our business strategy centers, in part, on offering real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans secured by real estate in order to generate interest income.these types of loans generally have higher yields due to an elevated risk profile compared to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.at march 31, 2014 real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage, and equity line lending(which includes junior lien mortgage loans) totaled $588.5 million, and $125.4 million, respectively. these loan categories combined represented approximately 52.9% of total loans.such loans increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have lower concentrations of real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans.loans secured by real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage properties are generally for larger amounts than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties.accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy.while we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.equity line lending allows a customer to access an amount up to their line of credit for the term specified in their agreement.at the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan.we cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines.while we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses. our loan portfolio contains loans used to finance construction and land development.construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property‚Äôs value at completion of construction, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction.if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project.if the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment.when lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal.although our underwriting criteria were designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to our operations. 53hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationat march 31, 2014 we had loans of $149.1 million or 11.0% of total loans outstanding to finance construction and land development.construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance, however, in many cases such construction and development projects in our primary market areas are not being completed in a timely manner, if at all.a portion of our residential and real estate ‚Äì commercial mortgage lending is secured by vacant or unimproved land.loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally more risky than loans secured by improved property for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. since vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business.these loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.if the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.with approximately three-fourths of our loans concentrated in the regions of hampton roads, richmond, the eastern shore of virginia, and the research triangle region of north carolina, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans.a decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses.also a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse.the local economies where the company does business are heavily reliant on military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that might result from recent congressional budgetary enactments.real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters.while our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property.we have had large numbers of problem loans, relative to our peers.although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so.our non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plusnonaccrualloans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 5.16% and 5.29% at march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. on march 31, 2014, less than 1% of our loans was 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets.the administration of non-performing loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our non-performing assets.the determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect.if such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. we maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management‚Äôs best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans.our allowance for loan losses was $31.3 million at march 31, 2014, which represented 2.32% of our total loans, as compared to $35.0 million, or 2.53% of total loans, at december 31, 2013.the level of the allowance reflects management‚Äôs estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.for further discussion on the impact continued weak economic conditions have on the collateral underlying our loan portfolio, see ‚Äúif the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to further decline materially, the value of our other real estate owned could decline or a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.‚Äù 54hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationthe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.in addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans.such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.furthermore, certain proposed changes to gaap, if implemented as proposed, may require us to increase our estimate for losses embedded in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital.accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance for loan losses may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen.any such increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.our profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.our profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.these rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management‚Äôs view of our needs.changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the prices of securities, loans and deposits, and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business, and could result in decreases to our earnings. our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments.this could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.we may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.deposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. under current conditions, pricing pressures also may arise from depositors who demand premium interest rates from whatthey perceive to be a troubled financial institution. there is intense competition for deposits. the competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. in addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.furthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize fdic insurance coverage. in addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. it is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. in order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term. finally, we may see interest rate pricing pressure from depositors concerned about our financial condition and levels of non-performing assets.we face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams.financial institutions are a prime target of criminal activities through various channels of information technology. we attempt to mitigate risk from such activities through policies, procedures, and preventative and detective measures. in addition, we maintain insurance coverage designed to provide a level of financial protection to our business. however, risks posed by business interruption, fraud losses, business recovery expenses, and other potential losses or expenses that may be experienced from a significant event are not readily predictable and, therefore, could have an impact on our results of operations.our operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area.because a substantial portion of our loans are with customers and businesses located in the central and coastal portions of virginia, north carolina, delaware, and maryland, catastrophic events, including natural disasters such as hurricanes which have historically struck the east coast of the united states with some regularity, or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our operations. any of these natural disasters or other catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our financial centers and customer base as well as collateral values and the strength of our loan  55hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationportfolio. any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the market price of our common stock.the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states department of justice, criminal division (‚Äúdoj‚Äù).although the company has been advised that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time and we do not believe we will become a target or a subject of the investigation, there can be no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of the related investigation.on november2, 2010, the company received from the doj a grand jury subpoena to produce information principally relating to the merger of gfh into the company on december31, 2008 and to loans made by gfh and its wholly-owned subsidiary, gateway, before gfh‚Äôs merger with the company. the doj has informed the company that it is not a target or a subject of the investigation at this time, and we are fully cooperating.although we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company, we can give you no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of this investigation.the company is not aware of any recent developments in this matter and has not been notified of any developments in over a year.the company has not had contact with the doj related to the grand jury subpoena since april 2011.risks relating to market, legislative, and regulatory events our business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry.the u.s. government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis.in addition to participating in the treasury‚Äôs tarp cpp, the u.s. government has taken steps that include enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, and increasing insured deposits.these programs subject us and other financial institutions who have participated in these programs to additional restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.compliance with such regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.we also will be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.the increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact our results of operations.new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the u.s. congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry.federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.we cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on us.additional regulation could affect us in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.banking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors. we are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies.the regulators‚Äô interpretation and application of relevant regulations, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth.in addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on march 26, 2014 the company and bohr entered into the mou with the frb and the bfi. under the mou, the company and bohr have agreed that they will receive the prior written approval of the frb and the bfi before: either the company or bohr declares or pays dividends of any kind;  56hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationthe company makes any payments on its trust preferred securities; the company incurs or guarantees any debt; or the company purchases or redeems any shares of its stock. in addition, the mou institutes certain reporting requirements and addresses ongoing regulatory requirements. shore is not a party to the mou and is not subject to its restrictions or requirements.all such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, the use of brokered deposits, and the creation of financial centers.although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors.the regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors. the fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states.its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin.it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities.its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. in addition, as a public company we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations.continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.in addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other requirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. government legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.on july 21, 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank act into law. the dodd-frank act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. in addition, the law mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action.the dodd-frank act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness for the financial services sector.many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have begun to be or will be implemented over the next few years and will be subject to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies.because the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act will depend on future regulatory rulemaking and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. although management does not expect the dodd-frank act to have a material adverse effect on the company, it is not possible to predict at this time all the effects the dodd-frank act will have on the company and the rest of our industry.it is possible that the company‚Äôs interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital.the full impact of the volcker rule, a component of the dodd-frank act, is yet to be determined.however, should the company have to divest itself of any investments deemed covered funds under the final rule, this may cause the recognition of current unrealized losses and negatively impact current operating results.on june 6, 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules to revise the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee in basel iii.these federal bank regulatory agencies approved final rules on july 2, 2013.the rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500.0 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (‚Äúbanking organizations‚Äù).although the final rules contain significant revisions from the proposed rules intended to provide relief to community banks, such as bohr and shore, many of the basel iii rules will apply to these institutions.among other things, the rules establish a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher  57hampton roads bankshares, inc.part ii.other informationminimum tier 1 capital requirement, changes in the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in the calculation of regulatory capital, and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property.the rules also limit a banking organization‚Äôs capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.for community banking organizations, the rules will be phased in beginning in 2015 and 2016.the company is diligently assessing the impact of this rule making on our capital and the amount of capital required to support our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.for further discussion of these issues, see the ‚Äúgovernment supervision and regulation‚Äùsection found in‚Äúpart i, item 1 ‚Äì business‚Äù of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, and incorporated by reference herein.proposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.the cfpb has issued a rule designed to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the dodd-frank act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay a mortgage. loans that meet this definition of ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. under the cfpb‚Äôs rule, a ‚Äúqualified mortgage‚Äù loan must not contain certain specified features, including:excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less ‚Äúbona fide discount points‚Äù for prime loans);interest-only payments;negative-amortization; andterms longer than 30 years.also, to qualify as a ‚Äúqualified mortgage,‚Äù a borrower‚Äôs total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. the cfpb‚Äôs rule on qualified mortgages and similar rules could limit our ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and time-consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry, generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.in addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us.there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of, or market for, our common stock. item 2 - unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceedsthe company announced an open ended program on august 13, 2003, by which management was authorized to repurchase an unlimited number of shares of the company‚Äôs common stock in the open

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note a ‚Äì basis of presentation and significant accounting policiesthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation (the "company" or "yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank. the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of  the company's 2015 form 10-k. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. results of operations for the three months ended march31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending december31, 2016. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. recently adopted and issued accounting standardsin march 2016, the financial accounting standards board (‚Äúfasb‚Äù) issued new guidance related to stock compensation. the new guidance eliminates the concept of apic pools for stock-based awards and requires that the related excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. the new guidance also allows entities to make a one-time policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur, instead of accruing compensation cost based on the number of awards expected to vest. additionally, the new guidance changes the requirement for an award to qualify for equity classification by permitting tax withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rate instead of the minimum statutory tax rate. cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. in march 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to derivatives and hedging. the new guidance clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is used to determine whether the embedded derivative should be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as a derivative. an entity performing the assessment will be required to assess the embedded call or put options solely in accordance with the pre-existing four-step decision sequence. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. the company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.in february 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to leases. the new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities related to certain operating leases on the balance sheet. the new guidance also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. the company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.in january 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the new guidance addresses the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. the company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.in september 2015, the fasb issued new guidance related to business combinations. the new guidance requires acquirers to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts (that are identified during the measurement period) in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the new guidance also requires such amounts to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. the company early-adopted this guidance effective september 30, 2015. the adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements.in may 2015, the fasb issued new guidance related to fair value measurement. the new guidance eliminates the requirement to classify in the fair value hierarchy any investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical - 9 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)expedient. this guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.in april 2015, the fasb issued new guidance related to debt issuance costs.the new guidance requires a reporting entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this guidance.this guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively. as of march31, 2016, the company had $568 of debt issuance costs that were included in long-term debt.in may 2014, the fasb issued new guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. this guidance provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. this guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. this guidance is effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. the company continues to evaluate the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. note b ‚Äì per share resultsbasic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. diluted net income per share reflects the dilutive impact of restricted stock as well as the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive common stock options and common stock warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the company. basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below.three months ended march 31,20162015weighted average number of common shares38,102,92631,606,909dilutive effect of stock options, stock warrants and restricted

mergers and acquisitionsacquisition of newbridge bancorpon march 1, 2016, the company completed its acquisition of newbridge bancorp (‚Äúnewbridge‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated october 12, 2015 (the ‚Äúnewbridge merger agreement‚Äù). pursuant to the newbridge merger agreement, each share of newbridge class a common stock and class b common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares of the common stock of the company (the "newbridge merger"). based on the company's stock price at the closing date of the newbridge merger, purchase consideration totaled $431,336. immediately following the merger of newbridge into yadkin, newbridge bank, a north carolina-chartered commercial bank, merged with and into yadkin bank, with yadkin bank surviving such merger. the newbridge merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with yadkin as the legal and accounting acquirer and newbridge as the legal and accounting acquiree. the assets and liabilities of newbridge have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of yadkin for periods following the merger date. the company may refine its valuations of acquired newbridge assets and liabilities for up to one year following the merger date. the newbridge merger had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the newbridge merger may not be comparable to financial results prior to the merger.- 10 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the purchase price is calculated based on the number of yadkin shares issued multiplied by the share price as shown in the following table. the purchase price

costs, and reversal of $9,844 in previously-existing fair value discount recognized by newbridge in prior acquisitions. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(c) adjustment reflects the elimination of newbridge's historical allowance for loan losses of $21,100. (d) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on acquired branch and administrative offices. (e) adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments.(f) adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible, net of the reversal of core deposit intangible recorded by newbridge in prior acquisitions.(g) adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include adjustments related to the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans, recognition of a servicing asset related to u.s. small business association ("sba") loans, and termination of certain derivative contracts. (h) adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. (i) adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for a short-term repurchase obligation and federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances. the repurchase obligation was valued by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for a similar - 11 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)instrument. for fhlb advances, the fair value was calculated by reference to the acquisition date prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.(j) adjustments reflect fair value adjustments for subordinated debt obligations and junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities outstanding at the acquisition date.  (k) adjustments reflect compensation obligations, reserve for unfunded commitments, benefit costs for merger-related obligations, and miscellaneous other accrued liabilities. (l) goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets.supplemental pro forma informationthe table below presents supplemental pro forma information as if the newbridge merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was january 1, 2015. pro forma results include adjustments for amortization and accretion of fair value

position111121as of march31, 2016, 36 securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than a twelve month period. the company had $200 thousand in gross unrealized losses on two corporate bonds that had been in unrealized loss positions for more than twelve months as of march31, 2016. these were the only securities in  loss positions for this period of time that were not issued or guaranteed by a u.s. government agency or gse. based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for these corporate issuers, the company does not believe the unrealized losses on these bonds were due to credit events.the securities in an unrealized loss position as of march31, 2016 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of march31, 2016. as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, the company held no individual investment securities with an aggregate book value greater than 10 percent of total shareholders‚Äô equity. as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, investment securities with carrying values of $395,756 and $279,953, respectively, were pledged

loan losses ("alll") includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. for loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd") for each loan grouping. pds represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and lgds represent the estimated magnitude of loss the company will incur if a loan defaults. a loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. the company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. the company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings:‚Ä¢pass.  these loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted.‚Ä¢special mention. loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. loans where adverse economic conditions have developed that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt, but substantially increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating.‚Ä¢substandard.  loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.‚Ä¢doubtful.  loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.- 16 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following tables summarize the risk category of loans by

company may modify certain loans under terms that are below market in order to maximize the amount collected from a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties. these modifications are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ("tdrs"). tdrs are evaluated individually for impairment based on the collateral value, if the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or discounted expected cash flows, if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. the company has no commitments to lend additional funds to any borrowers that have had a loan modified in a tdr. the following table provides the number and recorded investment of tdrs outstanding.- 19 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per

that were modified in the twelve months ended march31, 2015 subsequently defaulted during the three months ended march31, 2015. the company does not generally forgive principal or unpaid interest when restructuring loans. therefore, the recorded investment in tdrs during 2016 and 2015 did not change following the modifications. note f - purchased accounts receivablethe company invests in short-term trade accounts receivable, which are purchased on an exchange, using qualified intermediaries. these receivables have repayment terms of less than one year. income from purchased accounts receivable, which is recorded in other non-interest income, totaled $168 and $119, respectively, in the three months ended march 31, 2016 and 2015.purchased accounts receivable include delinquent short-term receivables of $7,900 at march31, 2016 that are due from a u.s. bioenergy company that produces ethanol, with the debt guaranteed by its spanish parent company. the spanish parent company commenced pre-insolvency proceedings in spain during november, 2015. an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against the u.s. subsidiary in the district of kansas on february 11, 2016. on february 24, 2016, a related u.s. subsidiary of the spanish parent company filed a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the eastern district of missouri, along with various affiliates, including the u.s. subsidiary, with joint administration requested. on february 29, 2016, the kansas case for the u.s. subsidiary was converted to a voluntary chapter 11 case, with venue transferred to the eastern district of missouri on march 1, 2016. on march 10, 2016, the spanish parent company announced the basis of a debt restructuring agreement that, among other things, will give selected financial creditors of the spanish parent a controlling stake in the company in return for a 70 percent reduction in the spanish parent company‚Äôs outstanding debt as well as $2,000,000 in additional loans. under governing law, the parent company needs to present a restructuring plan to a spanish court to avoid insolvency proceedings. any such transaction would also require approval of at least 75 percent of creditors. on march 28, 2016, creditors consented to a standstill agreement for seven months to give the company time to complete its restructuring. at this time, management lacks sufficient information to determine the extent of loss on the investment in purchased accounts receivable in the pending bankruptcy case for the u.s. subsidiary. management similarly lacks sufficient information to determine the extent of recovery possible on the guarantee by the spanish parent company. there was no contingency accrual related to this potential exposure as of march31, 2016. - 20 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note g ‚Äì loan servicingmortgage loan servicingthe company retains the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold. the unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others was $584,440 and $563,802 as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, respectively. mortgage servicing rights ("msrs") are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. msrs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $358 and $293, respectively, in the three months ended march31, 2016 and 2015. the following table summarizes msr activity for the periods presented. three months ended march 31,20162015balance at beginning of

period(53)(255)balance at end of period after valuation allowance$5,057$4,113msrs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans, and impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. if impairment exists at the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table.the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msrs. generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the msr. measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.the characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table.march 31, 2016december31, 2015composition of mortgage loans serviced for others:fixed rate loans99.90%99.90%adjustable rate

above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. also, in the preceding table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs is calculated without changing any other assumptions. frequently, changes in one factor would  result in another factor changing, which would magnify or contract the effect of the change.sba-guaranteed loan servicing the company retains the servicing rights on sba-guaranteed loans sold to investors. the standard sale structure under the sba secondary participation guaranty agreement provides for the company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. the unpaid principal balance of sba-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was $213,056 and $205,879 as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, respectively. sba-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. sba servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. sba servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $524 and $371, respectively, in the three months ended march 31, 2016 and 2015.the table below summarizes the activity in the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset for

amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against sba income. there was no valuation allowance recorded on the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of march31, 2016 or december31, 2015.note h ‚Äì commitments and contingenciesthe company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the company has in particular classes of financial instruments. the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. the company evaluates each customer‚Äôs creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit.the following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the company‚Äôs exposure to off-balance sheet commitments.- 22 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial

respectively, which was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.note i ‚Äì derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. these instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income ("oci") for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives. interest rate swapsthe table below provides a summary of forward starting pay fixed interest rate swaps that are being used to hedge short-term fhlb advances. these interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in the three-month libor component of three-month fhlb advances. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each interest rate swap.interest rate swapnotional

used to hedge a floating rate subordinated term loan and certain floating rate trust preferred securities ("trups"). the underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month libor. in the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate. these interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in oci. the following table summarizes key terms of each interest rate

forward sale commitments are entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. these derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. the fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.- 24 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial

price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy. the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.investment securities. securities available for sale ("afs") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurements are based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, third-party pricing sources are generally utilized to determine fair value. these fair values are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. level 1 securities include securities traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, or sba-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. level 2 securities generally include gse securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, and collateralized loan obligations. level 3 securities include one municipal bond and certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented. three months ended march 31,20162015level 3 afs securities at beginning of period$6,728$11,290purchases ‚Äî‚Äîsales, calls or maturities‚Äî‚Äîchanges in unrealized gains and

amounts)sba-guaranteed loans. the company has elected to account for certain sba-guaranteed loans at fair value on a recurring basis. generally, the company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. the unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring level 2.derivatives. derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. currently outstanding derivatives, except for mortgage interest rate lock commitments described below, are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.mortgage loan commitments. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 3. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented. three months ended march 31,20162015interest rate lock commitments at beginning of period$408$342issuances2,7611,465settlements(2,044)(1,171)interest rate lock commitments at end of period$1,125$636the fair value of forward sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 2. the difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations.loans. loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. however, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. the fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. for impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. when the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring level 2. when an appraised value is not available, or the company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring level 3.foreclosed assets. foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to foreclosed assets. subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management‚Äôs estimation of the value of the collateral. given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the company classifies foreclosed assets as nonrecurring level 3.- 26 -yadkin financial

unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company‚Äôs interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company‚Äôs mortgage banking department.due to the nature of the company‚Äôs business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. the fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. in addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company taken as a whole.cash and cash equivalents. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are a reasonable estimate of fair value.investment securities available for sale. a description of fair value estimates for securities available for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.investment securities held to maturity. the fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. these securities are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs.loans held for sale. the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market. a description of fair value estimates for sba-guaranteed loans held for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.loans. expected cash flows are forecasted over the remaining life of each loan and are discounted to present value at current market interest rates for similar loans considering loan collateral type and credit quality.federal home loan bank stock. given the option to redeem this stock at par through the fhlb, the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value.- 28 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)purchased accounts receivable. purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value, which is the same as the discounted purchase price, and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.deposits. the fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and now accounts represents the amount payable on demand. the fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities.short-term borrowings and long-term debt. the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at which borrowings of similar maturity could be obtained.accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable. the carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.derivative instruments. a description of fair value estimates for derivative instruments is included in the recurring fair value measurements section

under the laws of north carolina and headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. the company conducts its business operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank, a north-carolina chartered commercial bank.yadkin bank provides banking, mortgage, investment and insurance services to businesses and consumers across the carolinas.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company. this discussion and analysis includes descriptions of significant transactions, trends and other factors affecting the company‚Äôs operating results for the three-month periods ended march31, 2016 and 2015, as well as the financial condition of the company as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.executive summarythe following is a summary of the company‚Äôs financial highlights and significant events in the first quarter of 2016:‚Ä¢on march 1, 2016, the company completed its previously announced acquisition of newbridge bancorp and currently operates as the largest community bank based in north carolina with $7.4 billion in total assets, $5.3 billion in deposits, and $985 million in shareholders' equity.‚Ä¢net income available to common shareholders totaled $7.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in q1 2016 compared to $0.37 per diluted share in q4 2015 and $0.30 per diluted share in q1 2015.‚Ä¢net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain non-operating income and expenses, improved to $14.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in q1 2016 from $12.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in q4 2015 and $10.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in q1 2015.‚Ä¢annualized net operating return on average tangible common equity was 13.14 percent in q1 2016 compared to 13.14 percent in q4 2015 and 11.94 in q1 2015. annualized net operating return on average assets was 1.09 percent in q1 2016 compared to 1.14 percent in q4 2015 and 1.04 percent in q1 2015.  ‚Ä¢operating efficiency, the ratio of operating expenses to total operating revenues, was 58.1 percent in q1 2016 compared to 57.5 percent in q4 2015 and 62.1 percent in q1 2015.‚Ä¢asset quality improved following the acquisition of newbridge bancorp, as nonperforming loans to total loans declined to 0.83 percent as of march31, 2016 from 1.06 percent as of december 31, 2015 and 1.29 percent as of march 31, 2015.mergers and acquisitionsacquisition of newbridge bancorpon march 1, 2016, the company completed its acquisition of newbridge bancorp (‚Äúnewbridge‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated october 12, 2015 (the ‚Äúnewbridge merger agreement‚Äù). pursuant to the newbridge merger agreement, each share of newbridge class a common stock and class b common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares of the common stock of the company (the "newbridge merger"). based on the company's stock price at the closing date of the newbridge merger, purchase consideration totaled $431.3 million. immediately following the merger of newbridge into yadkin, newbridge bank, a north carolina-chartered commercial bank, merged with and into yadkin bank, with yadkin bank surviving such merger. the newbridge merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with yadkin as the legal and accounting acquirer and newbridge as the legal and accounting acquiree. the assets and liabilities of newbridge have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of yadkin for periods following the merger date. the company may refine its valuations of acquired newbridge assets and liabilities for up to one year following the merger date.- 31 -the company is currently the fourth largest bank headquartered in north carolina and ranks first by north carolina deposit market share among community banks. the company now operates 110 full-service banking locations in its north carolina and south carolina banking network and has a significant presence in all major north carolina markets, including charlotte, the raleigh-durham-chapel hill triangle, the piedmont triad, and wilmington. the company plans to complete systems integration in september 2016. the newbridge merger added $2.1 billion in loans, $2.0 billion in deposits, and resulted in significant changes across most balance sheet categories. additionally, since the merger was effective on march 1, 2016, the company's results of operations for the first quarter reflect the impact of newbridge for only one month. as a result, the company's first quarter 2016 financial results may not be comparable to financial results in prior periods.  non-gaap financial measuresstatements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-gaap financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures. the company's management uses these non-gaap financial measures, including: (i) net operating earnings available to common shareholders; (ii) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, (iii) operating non-interest income, (iv) operating non-interest expense, (v) operating efficiency ratio, (vi) taxable-equivalent net interest income, (vii) taxable-equivalent net interest margin, (viii) core net interest income, (ix) core net interest margin, (x) adjusted allowance for loan losses to loans; and (xi) tangible common equity, in its analysis of the company's performance. the adjusted allowance for loan losses non-gaap reconciliation is presented within the allowance for loan losses section below. the tangible common equity non-gaap reconciliations, which include tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, are presented within the capital section below.management believes that non-gaap financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company without regard to transactional activities.non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under gaap, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under gaap and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company.non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under gaap.three months ended march 31,(dollars in thousands, except per share data)20162015operating

quarter of 2016 compared to $9.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2015. net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2016 from $10.3 million in the comparable period of 2015. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $24.8

million in the first quarter of 2015. this increase was due to the impact of earning assets acquired in the newbridge merger and organic loan growth. net interest margin declined from 4.33 percent in the first quarter of 2015 to 4.05 percent in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower-yielding acquired newbridge loans. core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of accretion income on net interest income, was 3.70 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 3.74 percent in the first quarter of 2015.net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $3.6 million in the

accretion income on acquired loans in the first quarter of 2015 totaled $7.2 million, which included $1.3 million of net accretion on pci loans and $5.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $767 thousand of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $906 thousand

compared to $961 thousand in the first quarter of 2015. the higher provision for loan losses reflected higher provision expense on non-pci loans, net of a provision credit on pci loans. provision expense on non-pci loans increased due to higher net charge-offs and net loan growth. net charge-offs represented an annualized 0.15 percent of average loans in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an annualized 0.09 percent of average loans in the first quarter of 2015. the current period provision credit result from improving cash flows on certain of the company's pci loan pools. loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. if the company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. - 35 -if there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the company will first reverse any previously established alll and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans. events that would result in probable increases in expected cash flows include (i) increases in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming non-collateral dependent during the period for which there was an estimated collateral shortfall in prior estimations, (iii) actual cash flow collections in excess of prior estimates, and (iv) improvement in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors.results of the company‚Äôs cash flow re-estimation for pci loans in the first quarter of 2016 are summarized below.(dollars in thousands)provisionyield adjustmentprevious

increase from $31.0 million in the first quarter of 2015. the increase in expenses was primarily due to a $10.1 million increase in merger and conversion costs, which includes professional fees, personnel costs, and other expenses required to close the newbridge merger as well as costs to convert data processing, technology, signage, and branch network to the company's integrated platform. operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from $29.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 to $34.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other non-interest expense categories all increased as a result of the newbridge merger, which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the company's expense base. operating efficiency ratio, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, improved from 62.1 percent in the first quarter of 2015 to 58.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016. the company has made significant progress towards integrating newbridge onto its integrated platform based upon the merger plan. additionally, execution of the branch consolidation plan (12 branch closures scheduled in q2 and q3 2016), closures of two significant newbridge non-branch locations (scheduled for q3 2016), and completion of the systems integration (scheduled for september 2016) should enable the company to fully realize the cost savings and operational leverage that the newbridge merger provides. management believes the majority of projected cost savings will be achieved by the end of q3 2016 with remaining savings to be realized in q4 2016 and q1 2017.income taxesincome tax expense was $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2015. the company's effective tax rate totaled 38.7 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 36.3 percent in the first quarter of 2015. the higher effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2016 resulted from various nondeductible merger expenses related to the newbridge merger. analysis of financial

a major role in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity and, therefore, is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet. in general, the primary goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds as prescribed by law and other borrowings; (iii) to provide structures and terms to enable proper interest rate risk management; and (iv) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i), (ii) and (iii). the company invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations and its investment policy. these securities include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, u.s. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of state or political subdivisions, bank eligible corporate bonds, volcker rule-compliant collateralized loan obligations ("clos"), privately-issued residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, limited types of mutual funds, and equity securities.the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio were both $1.10 billion as of march31, 2016, compared to $694.5 million and $689.1 million, respectively, as of december31, 2015. the amortized cost and fair value of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio was $39.1 million and $40.7 million, respectively, as of march31, 2016 compared to $39.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively, as of december31, 2015. marketable investment securities accounted for as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to accumulated other comprehensive income. as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had $5.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of unrealized gains and $3.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of unrealized losses. marketable investment securities accounted for as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost.the securities in an unrealized loss position as of march31, 2016 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of march31, 2016. the following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio.march 31, 2016december31, 2015(dollars in

on the amortized cost of the securities.as of march31, 2016, the weighted average life of the company's debt securities was 4.5 years, and the weighted average effective duration was 2.8 years.the company owned $41.9 million and $24.8 million of federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, respectively. the fhlb stock is recorded at cost and is classified separately from investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets. lending activitiesthe primary goal of the company's lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the company. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. in this context, the company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality.the company provides a wide range of business and consumer loans in the markets it serves. its objective is to have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio of business and consumer loans. in order to manage loan portfolio risk, the company has established concentration limits by borrower, product type, loan structure, and industry. the majority of business loans are secured by business assets and real estate supported in most cases by personal guarantees. consumer loans are primarily secured with personal assets and real estate. underwriting is primarily focused on the underlying cash flow of the business or consumer and secondarily on assets securing the loans.  loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled $5.21 billion as of march31, 2016, which was an increase of $2.13 billion from december31, 2015. excluding acquired newbridge loans, the increase in loan balances was $71.1 million in

loan maturities are presented based on the final contractual maturity of each loan and do not reflect contractual principal payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans.loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. where possible, pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. for pci loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the pci loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for pci loans and not to contractual interest payments. the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. the recorded investment in pci loans as of march31, 2016 totaled $223.2 million, of which $222.3 million were grouped into pools and $914 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis. the recorded investment in pci loans as of december31, 2015 totaled $142.0 million, of which $141.2 million were grouped into pools and $855 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis.due to the significance of the acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, the company's current period credit metrics and ratios may not be comparable to those in prior periods or to credit metrics and ratios reported by other financial institutions. specifically, (i) alll to total loans, (ii) alll to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions.- 40 -nonperforming assetsloans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.  pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. these loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the company's pci loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. however, pci loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. the past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. in the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense.loans, excluding pooled pci loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (‚Äútdr‚Äù) by the company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. the company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. the company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. the company‚Äôs policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a tdr follows relevant supervisory guidance. that is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. if a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. the company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.pci loans that were classified as tdrs prior to acquisition are not classified as tdrs by the company after the acquisition date. subsequent modification of a pci loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a tdr is not reported, or accounted for, as a tdr since pooled pci loans are excluded from the scope of tdr accounting. a pci loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a tdr if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a tdr after the acquisition date.nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.83 percent as of march31, 2016, compared to 1.06 percent as of december31, 2015 and 1.29 percent as of march31, 2015. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.83 percent as of march31, 2016 compared to 1.07 percent as of december31, 2015 and 1.17 percent as of march31, 2015. acquired pci loans that are included in loan pools, including acquired yadkin pci loans, are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. - 41 -the following table summarizes the company's nonperforming assets as of the dates

yields.allowance for loan lossesthe alll is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. balances are charged against the alll when the collectability of principal is unlikely. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the alll. the alll is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. management evaluates the adequacy of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. for non-pci loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of alll includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. for loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd") for each loan grouping. pds represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and lgds represent the estimated magnitude of loss the company will incur if a loan defaults. a loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. a loan, excluding pci loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. pci loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment.- 42 -the following table presents the allocation of alll for the periods presented.march 31, 2016december31, 2015(dollars in thousands)amount%of totalamount%of

2016 compared to 0.32 percent as of december31, 2015. the decline in the alll ratio was due to acquired newbridge loans. at acquisition, these loans were adjusted to fair value, and the historical alll was eliminated. therefore, alll was unchanged as a result of the newbridge merger, but loan balances increased significantly. adjusted alll, which includes alll as well as net acquisition fair value adjustments for acquired loans, declined from 1.62 percent of total loans as of december31, 2015 to 1.50 percent of total loans as of march31, 2016. the reduction in adjusted alll was partially due to decreases in historical loss rates used in the alll model and was partially due to lower relative loss rates on the acquired newbridge loan portfolio.- 43 -the following non-gaap reconciliation

to businesses and individuals, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, iras and cds. these accounts generally earn interest at rates the company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. the establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. while the company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, brokered deposits represented 14.4 percent and 13.2 percent, respectively, of total deposits.total deposits as of march31, 2016 were $5.35 billion, which was an increase of $1.99 billion from december31, 2015. excluding acquired newbridge deposits, the increase in deposit balances was $49.3 million. as of march31, 2016 and december31, 2015, the company had outstanding time deposits under $100 thousand of $556.0 million and $335.3 million, respectively, and time deposits over $100 thousand of $907.2 million and $682.6 million, respectively.the table below provides a summary of the company‚Äôs deposit portfolio by deposit type.composition of deposit portfolio:march 31, 2016december31,

balances with reductions in the percentage of deposits held in time deposit accounts. the company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. the average cost of deposits was 0.35 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 0.36 percent in the first quarter of 2015 due to changes in deposit mix and rates. - 44 -borrowings and long-term debtthe company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. short-term borrowings, which consist of fhlb advances maturing within twelve months and a structured repurchase agreement acquired from newbridge which matures in december 2016, increased by $385.7 million in the first quarter. however, excluding acquired newbridge funds, short-term borrowings decreased by $86.6 million as the company used deposit growth and cash flows from the investment portfolio to reduce its borrowed funds balances.  long-term debt increased by $3.4 million in the first quarter. excluding acquired newbridge funds, long-term debt decreased by $28.4 million. long-term debt includes fhlb advances maturing beyond one year, subordinated debt, junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts ("trups"), and capital lease obligations. after the newbridge merger, the company began the process of extending and laddering out maturities on certain acquired fhlb advances to better balance the company's liquidity and interest rate risk profile. all newbridge fhlb advances at acquisition were set to mature within twelve months. the company expects long-term fhlb advances to increase in future periods as this maturity laddering process is completed.shareholders‚Äô equitytotal shareholders‚Äô equity was $984.6 million as of march31, 2016, which was an increase of $422.1 million from december31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to $431.3 million of net assets acquired in the newbridge merger, $7.8 million of net income earned in the quarter, and $1.6 million of net other comprehensive income, partially offset by $19.0 million of dividends paid on common stock.liquidityliquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. the company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the board of directors. investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, available borrowings from the fhlb, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the bank. the primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases. the primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are common stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and trups, and operating expenses. the primary sources of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the bank. in addition, the holding company maintains a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at libor plus 4.0 percent. the loan agreement will expire on july 1, 2016. however, the company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. the obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the bank.as of march31, 2016, the company's most liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities available for sale) totaled $1.21 billion, which represented 16 percent of total assets and 23 percent of total deposits. supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the company had available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of secured and unsecured lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled $388.1 million as of march31, 2016. as of march31, 2016, outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled $1.49 billion, standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb on the bank's behalf totaled $46.0 million, and outstanding capital commitments to a private investment fund were $4.7 million. management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded $5.56 billion, or 75 percent, of total assets as of march31, 2016 compared to $3.43 billion or 77 percent of total assets as of december31, 2015.- 45 -contractual obligationsthe following table presents the company's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date.

forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including without limitation, reduced earnings due to larger than expected credit losses in the sectors of our loan portfolio secured by real estate due to economic factors, including declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors; reduced earnings due to larger credit losses because our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; the rate of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off; the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods; costs or difficulties related to the integration of the banks we acquired or may acquire may be greater than expected; our ability to achieve the estimated synergies from the newbridge acquisition and once integrated, the effects of such business combination on our future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; our ability to integrate newbridge on our schedule and budget; results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or write down assets; the amount of our loan portfolio collateralized by real estate; our ability to maintain appropriate levels of capital; adverse changes in asset quality and resulting credit risk-related losses and expenses; increased funding costs due to market illiquidity, competition for funding, and increased regulatory requirements with regard to funding; significant increases in competitive pressure in the banking and financial services industries; changes in political conditions or the legislative or regulatory environment, including the effect of future financial reform legislation on the banking industry; general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally and especially in our primary service area, becoming less favorable than expected resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality; our ability to retain our existing customers, including our deposit relationships; changes occurring in business conditions and inflation; changes in monetary and tax policies; ability of borrowers to repay loans; risks associated with a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; changes in the assessment of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is necessary; our reliance on secondary liquidity sources such as federal home loan bank advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and out-of-market time deposits; loss of consumer confidence and economic disruptions resulting from terrorist activities or military actions; and changes in the securities markets. additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company‚Äôs filings with the securities and exchange commission, including without limitation its annual report on form 10-k, its quarterly reports on form 10-q, and its current reports on form 8-k. the forward-looking statements in this periodic report on form 10-q speak only as of the date of this periodic report, and the company does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements.item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. like many financial institutions, the company‚Äôs most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. this goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. the goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. the company's overall interest rate risk position is governed by policies approved by the board of directors and guidelines established and monitored by the bank‚Äôs asset/liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù).  to measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("nii") at risk, which measures the impact on nii over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("eve"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. nii at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on nii. eve is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the company's balance sheet, or equity. gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measure of the company's interest rate risk position. all of these models are subject to alco guidelines and are monitored regularly.- 48 -in calculating nii at risk, the company begins with a base amount of nii that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. the current yield curve is then ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or moved immediately, ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. new twelve-month and twenty four-month nii projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. the company also models other scenarios to evaluate potential nii at risk such as a gradual ramp in interest rates, a flattening yield curve, a steepening yield curve, and others that management deems appropriate.eve at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. the present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. the company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values.key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. these assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future nii or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nii and eve. actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. projections of nii are assessed as part of the company's forecasting process.nii and eve analysis.  the following table presents the estimated exposure to nii for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to eve due to immediate changes in interest rates. all information is presented as of march31, 2016.march31, 2016(dollars in thousands)estimated exposure to niiestimated exposure to eveimmediate

or eve valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher nii in the short term. other important factors that impact the levels of nii are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.item 4. controls and proceduresthe company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), as of march31, 2016. based on that evaluation, the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company‚Äôs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.there were no changes in

financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note a ‚Äì basis of presentation and significant accounting policiesthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation (the "company" or "yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank. the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of  the company's 2014 form 10-k. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. results of operations for the nine months ended september30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending december 31, 2015. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. ("vantagesouth") and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. ("piedmont"), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of yadkin at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont. financial results of the company following the mergers reflect balances of the combined organization. as required under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers. recently adopted and issued accounting standardsin september 2015, the financial accounting standards board (‚Äúfasb‚Äù) issued asu 2015-16: business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustments. the new guidance requires acquirers to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts (that are identified during the measurement period) in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the new guidance also requires such amounts to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. the company early adopted this guidance effective september 30, 2015. the adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements. in may 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-07: fair value measurement (topic 820): disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent) (a consensus of the emerging issues task force). the new guidance eliminates the requirement to classify in the fair value hierarchy any investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient. this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03: interest-imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in asu 2015-03 require a reporting entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments.the amendments in asu 2015-03 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and are to be applied retrospectively. as of september30, 2015, the company had $607 of debt issuance costs that were included in other assets. these costs will be reclassified to reduce the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the effective date.- 9 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-14, receivables - troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-14 require a reporting entity to de-recognize a mortgage loan and recognize a separate other receivable upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met. upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor. the amendments in asu no. 2014-14 were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-14 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-11, transfers and servicing (topic 860).  the amendments in asu 2014-11 change the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. the guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. asu 2014-11 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-11 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 provide a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu no. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is allowed. yadkin continues to evaluate the potential impact of asu no. 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables‚Äîtroubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-04 clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. the amendments in asu 2014-04 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-04 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-01, investments‚Äîequity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. the amendments in asu 2014-01 permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). the amendments in asu 2014-01 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-01 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. note b ‚Äì per share resultsbasic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common stock options and warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the company. basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based

acquisition of newbridge bancorp and newbridge bankon october 12, 2015, the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "newbridge merger agreement") with newbridge bancorp ("newbridge"), a bank holding company incorporated in north carolina and headquartered in greensboro, north carolina, pursuant to which the company will acquire newbridge and newbridge's wholly-owned subsidiary, newbridge bank, which will be merged with and into yadkin bank. for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition, see note k. mergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed the mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont pursuant to the merger agreement. at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.the piedmont phantom equity plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, was assumed by the company in the mergers. a total of 856,447 shares of yadkin‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont shareholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist was issued to a rabbi trust established by yadkin to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock. at the time of the mergers, 28,405 shares of yadkin's series t and t-acb preferred stock were assumed by the company. the series t and t-acb preferred stock rank equally and have identical terms. they have no maturity date and pay cumulative dividends of 9.0 percent annually. the company redeemed the series t and t-acb preferred stock in the second quarter of 2015. yadkin issued 17.3 million shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represented approximately 55 percent of the voting interests in the company at the time of the mergers. guidance in fasb asc 805-40-30-2 explains that the purchase price in a reverse merger is determined based on the number of equity interests the legal acquiree would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal acquirer the same equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. the first step in estimating the purchase price in the mergers is to determine the ownership of the combined institution following the mergers. the table below summarizes, for each shareholder group immediately prior to the mergers, the ownership of yadkin common stock immediately following the mergers as well as the market capitalization of the combined institution using yadkin‚Äôs stock price at the time of the mergers. - 12 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial

portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio.(b) adjustment reflects the elimination of yadkin's historical allowance for loan losses of $16,449 and the recording of a fair value discount of $47,189 on the loan portfolio. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(c) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on certain acquired branch offices as well as certain software and computer equipment. (d) adjustment reflects the write down of certain foreclosed assets based on current estimates of property values given current market conditions and additional discounts based on the company's planned disposition strategy. (e) adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments.(f) goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets.(g) adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. (h) adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include mortgage servicing assets, certain unusable prepaid expenses, and the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans. (i) adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. (j) adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for subordinated debt issued to fund trust preferred securities and long-term federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, which were calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for similar instruments. for fhlb advances, the fair value adjustment is consistent with the prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.(k) adjustments reflect accruals and fair value adjustments for other liabilities, which include the write-off of unearned income, deferred gains, and accrued liabilities that will not be paid. (l) no fair value adjustments were made to yadkin's outstanding preferred stock. the acquisition date preferred dividend rate of 9.0 percent approximated the then-current market yield for issuances of similar perpetual preferred stock. the preferred stock was redeemable at the liquidation value on the acquisition date, and the company expected the remaining life of the preferred stock would be relatively short. (m) the fair value of the common stock warrants was estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model assuming all 91,178 warrants will remain outstanding through expiration on july24, 2019. assumptions and inputs used in the option pricing model included stock price volatility of 48.6 percent, no dividends, a risk free interest rate of 1.74 percent, and an exercise price of $21.90 per common warrant.(n) amount reflects adjustments to goodwill resulting from adjustments (o), (p) and (q).(o) amount reflects an adjustment to estimated fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible.(p) amount reflects adjustments to acquired deferred tax assets and the tax impact of adjustments (o) and (q).(q) amount reflects the adjustment of change in control obligations existing under various employment agreements that were triggered by the mergers, an increase in reserves for unfunded letters of credit, and additional accruals for certain legal matters and other liabilities.

fifty-two securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than a twelve month period. the company had $111 thousand and $13 thousand in gross unrealized losses on one corporate bond and one non-agency rmbs, respectively, that had been in unrealized loss positions for more than twelve months as of september30, 2015. these were the only securities in  loss positions for this period of time that were not issued or guaranteed by a u.s. government agency or gse. based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for this corporate issuer, the company does not believe the unrealized loss on this bond was due to credit events.the securities in an unrealized loss position as of september30, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of september30, 2015. as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company held no individual investment

includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. for loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd") for each loan grouping. pds represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and lgds represent the estimated magnitude of loss the company will incur if a loan defaults. a loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine the alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. in the second quarter of  2015, the company enhanced its alll methodology by transitioning to the pd/lgd approach to calculating historical loss rates by loan grouping, as previously described. in prior periods, the company calculated historical loss rates by loan type and then weighted these loss rates across its risk grade scale. both methods use historical loss rates to calculate reserves on loans evaluated collectively for impairment, but the company believes the enhanced pd/lgd approach provides a more precise and consistent estimate of loan losses across the risk grade scale based on actual default data. the enhanced alll calculation did not have a material impact on the total alll as of june 30, 2015, or on the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2015; however, the enhanced alll methodology did change the allocation of alll across certain loan classes, particularly commercial and industrial and construction loans. the company held other significant inputs into the alll model consistent, such as the "lookback" period used to develop historical loss rates, the loan groupings for collective evaluation, and the application of qualitative factors. there were also no changes to the company's evaluation of individually impaired loans.- 21 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. the company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings:‚Ä¢pass.  these loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted.‚Ä¢special mention. loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. loans where adverse economic conditions have developed that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt, but substantially increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating.‚Ä¢substandard.  loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.‚Ä¢doubtful.  loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.the following tables summarize the risk category of loans by class of loans.passspecialmentionsubstandarddoubtfultotalseptember30, 2015non-pci loanscommercial:real estate$1,277,936$32,061$23,909$‚Äî$1,333,906commercial

borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties. these modifications are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ("tdrs"). tdrs are evaluated individually for impairment based on the collateral value, if the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or discounted expected cash flows, if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. the company has no commitments to lend additional funds to any borrowers that have had a loan modified in a tdr. the following table provides the number and recorded investment of tdrs outstanding.september30, 2015december31,

balance of loans serviced for investors was $540,770 and $455,033 as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. mortgage servicing rights ("msrs") are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. msrs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $326 and $928, respectively, in the three and nine months ended september30, 2015. the following table summarizes msr activity for the 2015 periods presented. three months ended september 30,nine months ended september 30,2015201420152014balance at

impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. if impairment exists at the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table.the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msrs. generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the msr. measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.- 26 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table.september

hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. also, in the preceding table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs is calculated without changing any other assumptions. frequently, changes in one factor would  result in another factor changing, which would magnify or contract the effect of the change.sba-guaranteed loan servicing the company retains the servicing rights on sba-guaranteed loans sold to investors. the standard sale structure under the sba secondary participation guaranty agreement provides for the company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. the unpaid principal balance of sba-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was $204,339 and $136,093 as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. sba-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. sba servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. sba servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $473 and $295 for the three months ended september 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $1,258 and $739 for the nine months ended september 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the table below summarizes the activity in the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset for the periods presented.three months ended september 30,nine months ended september

servicing asset is compared to the amortized basis when certain triggering events occur. if the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against sba income. there was no valuation allowance recorded on the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of september30, 2015 or december31, 2014.- 27 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note g ‚Äì commitments and contingenciesthe company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the company has in particular classes of financial instruments. the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. the company evaluates each customer‚Äôs creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit.the following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the company‚Äôs exposure to off-balance sheet commitments.september30, 2015december31, 2014lending

liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.note h ‚Äì derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. these instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income ("oci") for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives. interest rate swapsin 2013 and 2014, the company entered into six different forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $175,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.in august 2014, the company entered into two additional forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted brokered money market deposits to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in one-month libor, which is the underlying index of the brokered money market deposits. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps began to exchange one-month libor, plus the applicable spread, with fixed interest rates. the brokered money market accounts are expected to maintain at least $50,000 on deposit with the company through the maturity of the interest rate swaps. in march 2015, the company restructured certain of its derivative positions by terminating four interest rate swaps prior to their effective start dates and entering into two new forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates of 2.540 and 2.576 percent. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.- 28 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the interest rate swaps outstanding as of september 30, 2015 are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key terms of each active interest rate swap.interest rate swapnotional amounteffective start datematurity datepay fixed

contracts on $25,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to yadkin valley statutory trust i and on $10,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to american community capital trust. the underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month libor. in the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate. these interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key terms

entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. these derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. the fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.the following table summarizes the balance sheet location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments

liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy. the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.investment securities. securities available for sale ("afs") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurements are based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, third-party pricing sources are generally utilized to determine fair value. these fair values are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. level 1 securities include securities traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, or sba-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. level 2 securities generally include gse securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, and collateralized loan obligations. level 3 securities include one municipal bond and certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented. - 30 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in

loans. the company has elected to account for certain sba-guaranteed loans at fair value on a recurring basis. generally, the company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. the unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring level 2.derivatives. derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. currently outstanding derivatives, except for mortgage interest rate lock commitments described below, are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.mortgage loan commitments. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 3. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented. three months ended september 30,nine months ended september 30,2015201420152014interest rate lock commitments at beginning of

period$640$447$640$447the fair value of forward sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 2. the difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations.loans. loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. however, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. the fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. for impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. when the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring level 2. when an appraised value is not available, or the company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring level 3.foreclosed assets. foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to foreclosed assets. subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management‚Äôs estimation of the value of the collateral. given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the company classifies foreclosed assets as nonrecurring level 3.- 31 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following

unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company‚Äôs interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company‚Äôs mortgage banking department.due to the nature of the company‚Äôs business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. the fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. in addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company taken as a whole.cash and cash equivalents. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are a reasonable estimate of fair value.investment securities available for sale. a description of fair value estimates for securities available for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.investment securities held to maturity. the fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. these securities are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs.loans held for sale. the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market. a description of fair value estimates for sba-guaranteed loans held for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.loans.

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)purchased accounts receivable. purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value, which is the same as the discounted purchase price, and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.deposits. the fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and now accounts represents the amount payable on demand. the fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities.short-term borrowings and long-term debt. the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at

pursuant to which the company will acquire newbridge. newbridge‚Äôs wholly-owned subsidiary, newbridge bank, which will be merged with and into yadkin‚Äôs wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank.the company will acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of newbridge in exchange for shares of yadkin‚Äôs common stock. the exchange ratio has been fixed at 0.50 shares ofyadkin‚Äôs common stock for each share ofnewbridge which equates to a deal value of $11.40 per share, or approximately $456 million in the aggregate, based on yadkin's closing price of $22.79 as of october 12, 2015. upon closing of the merger, yadkin shareholders will own approximately 61.3% of the combined company and newbridge's existing shareholders will own approximately 38.7% of the combined company.- 37 -as of september 30, 2015, the combined company would have total assets of $7.3 billion, deposits of $5.2 billion and loans of $5.0 billion. yadkin will operate in all major north carolina markets, enhancing its statewide presence in its existing footprint and expanding into the piedmont triad.the transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.newbridge bank is a full-service community bank with 41 branches in north carolina and a single branch in the charleston, south carolina vicinity. the north carolina branches are clustered in the piedmont triad area, and in the cities and surrounding communities of raleigh, charlotte, and wilmington. mergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù) and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.non-gaap financial measuresstatements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-gaap financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures. the company's management uses these non-gaap financial measures, including: (i) net operating earnings available to common shareholders; (ii) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, (iii) operating non-interest income, (iv) operating non-interest expense, (v) operating efficiency ratio, (vi) adjusted allowance for loan losses to loans; and (vii) tangible common equity, in its analysis of the company's performance. the adjusted allowance for loan losses non-gaap reconciliation is presented within the allowance for loan losses section below. the tangible common equity non-gaap reconciliations, which include tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, are presented within the capital section below.management believes that non-gaap financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company without regard to transactional activities.non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under gaap, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under gaap and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company.non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under gaap.- 38 -three months ended september 30,nine months ended september 30,(dollars in thousands, except per

diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2015, which was an increase from $319 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2014. net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 from $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $21.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 from $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2014.year-to-datenet income available to common shareholders was $32.0 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, in the first nine months of 2015 compared to $3.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share, in the first nine months of 2014. net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to $34.7 million in the first nine months of 2015 from $16.2 million in the comparable period of 2014. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $59.6 million in the first nine months of 2015 from $34.9 million in the same period of 2014.as discussed in greater detail below, the improvements in the results of operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, compared to the respective periods of 2014, reflect the benefit of significant operating leverage provided by the mergers. the balance sheet growth and customer base expansion have resulted in improved net interest income and non-interest income, while the company continues efforts to benefit from elimination of duplicative functions. net interest income q3 2015 compared to q3 2014net interest income was $39.3 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2014. the reduction in net interest income resulted from significant accretion of fair value discounts resulting from the mergers during the third quarter of 2014, with proportionately lower amounts accreted during the third quarter of 2015. average interest-earning assets increased from $3.53 billion in the third quarter of 2014 to $3.75 billion in the third quarter of 2015. over this period, average loan balances increased by $190.3 million and average investment securities increased by $15.7 million. in addition, average deposits increased by $95.6 million, the net effect of strong growth among noninterest-bearing deposits and a slight reduction in time deposits, while average short-term borrowings increased $146.7 million due to incremental fhlb borrowings. the company's net interest margin declined from 4.68 percent in the third quarter of 2014, the quarter in which the mergers occurred, to 4.19 percent in the third quarter of 2015. the lower current net interest margin reflects the anticipated reduction in accretion recognized on the loans that, as a result of the mergers, were recorded at fair value. interest rate pressure and stiff competition for loans from other financial institutions also had a negative impact on net interest margin. the aggregate yield on interest-earning assets declined from 5.12 percent in the third quarter of 2014, to 4.72 percent in the third quarter of 2015. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.54 percent in the third quarter of 2014 to 0.66 percent in the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher time deposit and fhlb borrowing costs.net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2015, which consisted of $895 thousand of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired (‚Äúpci‚Äù) loans and $2.5 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the third quarter of 2014 totaled $7.2 million, which included $1.3 million of net accretion on pci loans and $5.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $1.0 million of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2014.- 40 -the following

improved to $117.8 million in the first nine months of 2015 from $79.8 million in the first nine months of 2014. the increase in net interest income was the result of a significant increase in interest-earning assets from the mergers and organic business activity. average interest-earning assets increased from $2.42 billion in the first nine months of 2014 to $3.71 billion in the first nine months of 2015. over this period, average loan balances increased by $1.10 billion, average investment securities increased by $194.2 million, and average deposits increased by $1.07 billion. each of these increases reflects the impact of the acquired yadkin balances for the third quarter of 2014. the company's net interest margin contracted from 4.42 percent in the first nine months of 2014 to 4.27 percent in the first nine months of 2015. the lower net interest margin reflected the anticipated reduction in accretion of fair value discounts related to acquired loans in quarters following the mergers. loan yields were also adversely affected by interest rate pressure and stiff competition for new loans from other financial institutions. the impact of the lower accretion was partially offset by an improved mix of interest-earning assets, a higher taxable-equivalent yield on investment securities, and an improved funding mix. the aggregate yield on interest-earning assets declined from 4.95 percent in the first nine months of 2014 to 4.80 percent in the first nine months of 2015. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.61 percent in the first nine months of 2014 to 0.65 percent in the first nine months of 2015.net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $12.7 million in the first nine months of 2015, which consisted of $4.0 million of net accretion on pci loans and $8.7 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the first nine months of 2014 totaled $13.1 million, which included $3.3 million of net accretion on pci loans and $9.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $3.4 million of accelerated

the higher provision for loan losses reflected higher provision expense on non-pci loans, net of lower provision expense on pci loans. provision expense on non-pci loans increased due to higher net charge-offs and loan growth. net charge-offs represented an annualized 0.12 percent of average loans in the third quarter of 2015 compared to an annualized 0.09 percent of average loans in the third quarter of 2014. loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. if the company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. - 44 -if there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the company will first reverse any previously established alll and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans. events that would result in probable increases in expected cash flows include (i) increases in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming non-collateral dependent during the period for which there was an estimated collateral

result of the efficiency improvement and operating leverage resulting from the mergers and subsequent system conversion, the company's operating efficiency ratio improved from 61.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014 to 57.3 percent in the third quarter of 2015.lower merger and conversion costs partially offset higher non-interest expenses in the quarter. these costs included professional fees, severance, technology, rebranding, and branch network expenses necessary to complete the mergers and related system conversions. - 46 -year-to-datenon-interest expense totaled $92.1 million in the first nine months of 2015 compared to $85.4 million in the first nine months of 2014. salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other non-interest expense categories were all significantly impacted by the mergers which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the company's expense base. further, fdic deposit insurance premiums and intangible asset amortization were impacted by the acquired yadkin deposit base. operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from $63.7 million in the first nine months of 2014 to $88.6 million in the first nine months of 2015. due to the operating leverage resulting from balance sheet growth, the company's operating efficiency ratio improved from 64.6 percent in the first nine months of 2014 to 59.8 percent in the first nine months of 2015.lower merger and conversion costs partially offset higher non-interest expenses in 2015. merger and conversion costs included professional fees, severance, technology, rebranding, and branch network expenses necessary to complete the mergers and related system conversions. restructuring charges of $3.3 million in the first nine months of 2015 related to recognition of an obligation to a former executive officer and severance costs associated with the company's expense reduction and branch optimization plan. these plans resulted in the elimination of certain back office positions and include the planned closing or sale of six branches during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. restructuring charges of $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2014 related to an earlier branch optimization plan and efforts to streamline the company's organizational structure in certain back office functions following a 2013 acquisition by vantagesouth. income taxesq3 2015 compared to q3 2014income tax expense was $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $621 thousand in the third quarter of 2014. the company's effective tax rate totaled 40.1 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 39.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014. in 2013, north carolina enacted tax reform that established statutory corporate income tax rate reductions from 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2014 and down to 5.0 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2015 followed by two additional rate reductions that are contingent upon the amount of net general fund tax collections.specifically, the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 4 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2016, if tax collections in fiscal year 2014-2015 for the state exceed $20.2 billion.based on actual revenues exceeding the target, the north carolina corporate income tax rate will decline to 4 percent for tax years beginning on january 1, 2016. the company revalues its deferred tax assets when an income tax rate is deemed to have been legally enacted. therefore, the company revalued its net deferred tax asset during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a $651 thousand charge to income tax expense, net of the resulting federal benefit.year-to-datethe effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended september30, 2015 was 37.7 percent compared to 42.9 percent for the nine-month period ended september30, 2014. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to significant non-deductible merger expenses. analysis of financial conditioninvestment activitiesthe company's investment portfolio plays a major role in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity and, therefore, is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet. in general, the primary goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds as prescribed by law and other borrowings; (iii) to provide structures and terms to enable proper interest rate risk management; and (iv) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i), (ii) and (iii). the company invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations and its investment policy. these securities include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, u.s. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of state or political subdivisions, bank eligible corporate bonds, volcker rule-compliant collateralized loan obligations ("clos"), privately-issued residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, limited types of mutual funds, and equity securities.- 47 -the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio was $712.7 million and $713.5 million, respectively, as of september30, 2015, compared to $674.2 million and $672.4 million, respectively, as of december31, 2014. the amortized cost and fair value of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio was $39.3 million and $40.3 million, respectively, as of september30, 2015 compared to $39.6 million and $40.6 million, respectively, as of december31, 2014. the portfolio has increased year-to-date in 2015 as the company began allocating a portion of its portfolio to purchases of volcker rule-compliant clos, all of which are aa/aa2 rated bonds. clos are securitized pools of widely syndicated senior-secured, floating rate corporate loans. the company performs extensive pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing monitoring of all its clos, including but not limited to, evaluation of manager expertise and performance, compliance with the volcker rule, security structure, tranche subordination, over-collateralization tests, weighted average risk factor, stress tests, and underlying loan concentrations, covenants, and other characteristics.marketable investment securities accounted for as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to accumulated other comprehensive income. as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had $4.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of unrealized gains and $3.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of unrealized losses. marketable investment securities accounted for as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost.the securities in an unrealized loss position as of september30, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of september30, 2015. the following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio.september 30, 2015december31, 2014(dollars in

stock as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. the fhlb stock is recorded at cost and is classified separately from investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets. lending activitiesthe primary goal of the company's lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the company. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. in this context, the company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality.the company provides a wide range of business and consumer loans in the markets it serves. its objective is to have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio of business and consumer loans. in order to manage loan portfolio risk, the company has established concentration limits by borrower, product type, loan structure, and industry. the majority of business loans are secured by business assets and real estate supported in most cases by personal guarantees. consumer loans are primarily secured with personal assets and real estate. underwriting is primarily focused on the underlying cash flow of the business or consumer and secondarily on assets securing the loans.  loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled $2.98 billion as of september30, 2015, which was an increase of $81.5 million from december31, 2014, or a 3.8 percent annual growth rate. the table below provides a summary of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio by loan type.- 49 -composition of loan portfolio:september 30, 2015december

life of each loan and then discounting those cash flows based on market rates for similar loans at the time of initial recognition. because acquired loans are marked to fair value and the legacy allowance for loan losses is eliminated at acquisition, the company believes an analysis of the loan portfolio carrying value and unpaid borrower principal balances ("upb") is useful in evaluating the

payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans.- 50 -loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. where possible, pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. for pci loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the pci loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for pci loans and not to contractual interest payments. the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. the recorded investment in pci loans as of september30, 2015 totaled $159.7 million, of which $158.9 million were grouped into pools and $794 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis. the recorded investment in pci loans as of december31, 2014 totaled $206.1 million, of which $205.4 million were grouped into pools and $712 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis.due to the significance of the acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, the company's current period credit metrics and ratios may not be comparable to those in prior periods or to credit metrics and ratios reported by other financial institutions. specifically, (i) alll to total loans, (ii) alll to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions.nonperforming assetsloans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.  pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. these loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the company's pci loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. however, pci loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. the past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. in the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense.- 51 -loans, excluding pooled pci loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (‚Äútdr‚Äù) by the company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. the company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. the company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. the company‚Äôs policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a tdr follows relevant supervisory guidance. that is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. if a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. the company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.pci loans that were classified as tdrs prior to acquisition are not classified as tdrs by the company after the acquisition date. subsequent modification of a pci loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a tdr is not reported, or accounted for, as a tdr since pooled pci loans are excluded from the scope of tdr accounting. a pci loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a tdr if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a tdr after the acquisition date.nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.25 percent as of september30, 2015 compared to 0.92 percent as of december31, 2014 and 0.90 percent as of september30, 2014. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.12 percent as of september30, 2015 compared to 0.93 percent as of december31, 2014 and 0.88 percent as of september30, 2014. acquired pci loans that are included in loan pools, including acquired yadkin pci loans, are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. the following table summarizes the company's nonperforming assets.(dollars in thousands)september30, 2015december31, 2014nonaccrual loans$27,830$17,949accruing loans past due 90

provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. balances are charged against the alll when the collectability of principal is unlikely. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the alll. the alll is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. management evaluates the adequacy of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. for non-pci loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of the alll includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. for loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd") for each loan grouping. pds represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and lgds represent the estimated magnitude of loss the company will incur if a loan defaults. a loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine the alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. in the second quarter of 2015, the company enhanced its alll methodology by transitioning to the pd/lgd approach to calculating historical loss rates by loan grouping, as previously described. in prior periods, the company calculated historical loss rates by loan type and then weighted these loss rates across its risk grade scale. both methods use historical loss rates to calculate reserves on loans evaluated collectively for impairment, but the company believes the current pd/lgd approach provides a more precise estimate of loan losses across the risk grade scale based on actual default data. the enhanced alll calculation did not have a material impact on the total alll as of june30, 2015 or on the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2015. however, the enhanced alll methodology did change the allocation of alll across certain loan classes, particularly commercial and industrial and construction and development loans. the company held other significant inputs into the alll model consistent, such as the "lookback" period used to develop historical loss rates, loan groupings for collective evaluation, and the application of qualitative factors.a loan, excluding pci loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. pci loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment.the following table presents the

construction loans declined $38.6 million during the same period, as construction loans were either repaid or transferred to another loan class when the construction project ended and the permanent

and individuals, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, iras and cds. these accounts generally earn interest at rates the company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. the establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. while the company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. as of september30, 2015, brokered deposits represented 11.1 percent of total deposits.total deposits as of september30, 2015 were $3.25 billion, essentially unchanged from december31, 2014. as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company had outstanding time deposits under $100 thousand of $556.0 million and $547.5 million, respectively, and time deposits over $100 thousand of $474.9 million and $544.8 million, respectively.the table below provides a summary of the company‚Äôs deposit portfolio by deposit type.composition of deposit portfolio:september

higher percentage of non-interest demand deposits with reductions in the percentage of deposits held in interest-bearing demand and time deposit accounts. the company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. the average cost of deposits was 0.38 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 0.30 percent in the third quarter of 2014 due to changes in deposit mix and higher time deposit interest rates. - 55 -borrowings and long-term debtthe company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. short-term borrowings totaled $395.5 million and $250.5 million as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively, and consisted of fhlb advances maturing within twelve months. the balance of short-term fhlb advances increased during the year-to-date period to partially fund loan growth, investment purchases, and to compensate for the preferred stock redemption. the company also shifted some of its maturities from long-term to short-term as the mix of loan originations and loans in the pipeline continue to be weighted towards variable rate lending.long-term debt totaled $129.9 million as of september30, 2015, compared to $180.2 million as of december31, 2014. long-term debt included outstanding long-term fhlb advances of $54.0 million and $104.7 million as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. long-term debt also included $7.1 million in a subordinated term loan due in 2018 as well as $38.1 million in fixed rate subordinated notes due in 2023. as of september30, 2015, long-term debt also included a total of $24.9 million in junior subordinated debentures issued to various unconsolidated trusts that were formed to issue trust preferred securities. this amount grew from a balance of $24.4 million as of december31, 2014, due to accretion of fair value discounts related to the trust preferred securities. capital lease obligations, which are included in long-term debt, totaled $5.8 million and $6.0 million as of september30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.shareholders‚Äô equitytotal shareholders‚Äô equity was $556.8 million as of september30, 2015, which was a decrease of $1.0 million from december31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the preferred stock redemption of $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, a $1.9 million net other comprehensive loss, and $822 thousand of dividends paid on preferred stock prior to the redemption. the decrease was mostly offset by $32.8 million of year-to-date 2015 net income.liquidityliquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. the company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the board of directors. investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, available borrowings from the fhlb, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the bank. the primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases. the primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are common stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and trups, and operating expenses. the primary sources of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the bank. in addition, the holding company maintains a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at libor plus 4.0 percent. the loan agreement will expire on july 1, 2016. however, the company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. the obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the bank.as of september30, 2015, the company's most liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities available for sale) totaled $791.2 million, which represented 18 percent of total assets and 24 percent of total deposits. supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the company had available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of secured and unsecured lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled $388.1 million as of september30, 2015. as of september30, 2015, outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled $798.7 million, standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb on the bank's behalf totaled $10.0 million, and outstanding capital commitments to a private investment fund were $3.1 million. management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded $3.44 billion, or 79 percent, of total assets as of september30, 2015 compared to $3.50 billion or 82 percent of total assets as of december31, 2014.- 56 -contractual obligationsthe following table

maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. the company's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the company's risk profile, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to shareholders.   on july2, 2013, the federal reserve board, and on july9, 2013, the fdic, adopted a final rule that implements the basel iii changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the ‚Äúbasel iii rules.‚Äù the basel iii rules apply to both depository institutions and their holding companies. the basel iii rules, which became effective for both the company and the bank on january 1, 2015, include new risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements which refine the definition of what constitutes ‚Äúcapital‚Äù for purposes of calculating those ratios. the minimum capital level requirements applicable to the company and the bank under the basel iii rules are: (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from 4 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent for all institutions. common equity tier 1 capital will consist of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments. the basel iii rules also establish a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù of 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. the conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, result in the following minimum ratios: (i)a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. the new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in january 2016 at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january 2019. an institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.the basel iii rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. the prompt corrective action rules were modified to include a common equity tier 1 capital component and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. for example, under the proposed prompt corrective action rules, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as ‚Äúwell capitalized:‚Äù (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (increased from 6 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent (unchanged from current rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 percent (unchanged from previous rules). the basel iii rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. - 57 -the company's and the

forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including without limitation, reduced earnings due to larger than expected credit losses in the sectors of our loan portfolio secured by real estate due to economic factors, including declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors; reduced earnings due to larger credit losses because our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; the rate of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off; the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods; costs or difficulties related to the integration of the banks we acquired or may acquire may be greater than expected; factors relating to our proposed acquisition of newbridge, including our ability to consummate the transaction on a timely basis, if at all, our ability to effectively and timely integrate the operations of yadkin and newbridge, our ability to achieve the estimated synergies from this proposed transaction and once integrated, the effects of such business combination on our future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or write down assets; the amount of our loan portfolio collateralized by real estate; our ability to maintain appropriate levels of capital; adverse changes in asset quality and resulting credit risk-related losses and expenses; increased funding costs due to market illiquidity, competition for funding, and increased regulatory requirements with regard to funding; significant increases in competitive pressure in the banking and financial services industries; changes in political conditions or the legislative or regulatory environment,  including the effect of future financial reform legislation on the banking industry; general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally and especially in our primary service area, becoming less favorable than expected resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality; our ability to retain our existing customers, including our deposit relationships; changes occurring in business conditions and inflation; changes in monetary and tax policies; ability of borrowers to repay loans; risks associated with a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure,  or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation,  increase our costs and cause losses; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; changes in the assessment of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is necessary; our reliance on secondary liquidity sources such as federal home loan bank advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and out-of-market time deposits; loss of consumer confidence and economic disruptions resulting from terrorist activities or military actions; and changes in the securities markets. additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company‚Äôs filings with the securities and exchange commission, including without limitation its annual report on form 10-k, its quarterly reports on form 10-q, and its current reports on form 8-k. the forward-looking statements in this periodic report on form 10-q speak only as of the date of this report, and the company does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements.- 59 -- 60 -item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. like many financial institutions, the company‚Äôs most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. this goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. the goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. the company's overall interest rate risk position is governed by policies approved by the board of directors and guidelines established and monitored by the bank‚Äôs asset/liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù).  to measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("nii") at risk, which measures the impact on nii over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("eve"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. nii at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on nii. eve is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the company's balance sheet, or equity. gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measure of the company's interest rate risk position. all of these models are subject to alco guidelines and are monitored regularly.in calculating nii at risk, the company begins with a base amount of nii that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. the current yield curve is then ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or moved immediately, ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. new twelve-month and twenty four-month nii projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. the company also models other scenarios to evaluate potential nii at risk such as a gradual ramp in interest rates, a flattening yield curve, a steepening yield curve, and others that management deems appropriate.eve at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. the present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. the company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values.key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. these assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future nii or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nii and eve. actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. projections of nii are assessed as part of the company's forecasting process.nii and eve analysis.  the following table presents the estimated exposure to nii for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to eve due to immediate changes in interest rates. all information is presented as of september30, 2015.september30, 2015(dollars in thousands)estimated exposure to niiestimated exposure to eveimmediate change in interest rates:+ 4.0%9.08%4.21%+

all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher nii in the short term. other important factors that impact the levels of nii are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.- 61 -item 4. controls and proceduresthe company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), as of september30, 2015. based on that evaluation, the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company‚Äôs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.there were no changes in the company‚Äôs internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal controls over financial reporting.- 62 -part ii.  other informationitem 1. legal proceedingsthe company and yadkin bank have been named defendants in legal actions arising from normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed. although the amount of any unrecorded liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any additional liability arising from these matters will not have a material effect on yadkin's consolidated financial statements.item 1a. risk factorsin addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in part i, ‚Äúitem 1a. risk factors‚Äù in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december31, 2014, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described in our annual report on form 10-k are not the only risks facing the company. additional risks and uncertainties known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  accordingly, there are or will be important factors related to the newbridge merger that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.  we believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the newbridge merger.before the newbridge merger and the newbridge bank merger may be completed, yadkin and newbridge must obtain approvals from the federal reserve board, the fdic and the north carolina commissioner of banks. other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. in determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party.  an adverse development in either party‚Äôs regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. these regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the newbridge merger or the newbridge bank merger or require changes to the terms of the newbridge merger or the newbridge bank merger. such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the newbridge merger or the newbridge bank merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the newbridge merger and the newbridge bank merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the newbridge merger. combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the newbridge merger may not be realized.yadkin and newbridge have operated and, until the completion of the newbridge merger, will continue to operate, independently. the success of the newbridge merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on yadkin‚Äôs ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of yadkin and newbridge in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company‚Äôs ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company‚Äôs ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the newbridge merger. the loss of key employees could adversely affect yadkin‚Äôs ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on yadkin‚Äôs financial results and the value of the yadkin common stock. if yadkin experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the newbridge merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. as with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause yadkin and/or newbridge to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from yadkin and/or newbridge and move their business to competing financial institutions. integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. in addition, the actual cost savings of the newbridge merger could be less than anticipated.termination of the newbridge merger agreement could negatively impact yadkin.if the newbridge merger agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. for example, yadkin‚Äôs businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the newbridge merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the newbridge merger. additionally, if the - 63 -newbridge merger agreement is terminated, the market price of yadkin‚Äôs common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the newbridge merger will be completed. if the newbridge merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, yadkin may be required to pay newbridge a termination fee of $18 million plus documented out-of-pocket transaction expenses.newbridge and yadkin will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the newbridge merger is pending.uncertainty about the effect of the newbridge merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on yadkin. these uncertainties may impair yadkin‚Äôsability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the newbridge merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with yadkin to seek to change existing business relationships with yadkin. retention of certain employees by yadkin may be challenging while the newbridge merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with yadkin. if key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with yadkin, yadkin‚Äôs business could be harmed. if the newbridge merger is not completed, yadkin will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the newbridge merger.yadkin has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the newbridge merger agreement, including a portion of the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the newbridge merger.  if the newbridge merger is not completed, yadkin would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the newbridge merger. these provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of yadkin from considering or proposing such an acquisition.item 2. unregistered sales of equity securities and

financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note a ‚Äì basis of presentation and significant accounting policiesthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation (the "company" or "yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank. the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of  the company's 2014 form 10-k. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. results of operations for the six months ended june30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending december 31, 2015. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. ("vantagesouth") and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. ("piedmont"), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of yadkin at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont. financial results of the company following the mergers reflect balances of the combined organization. as required under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers. recently adopted and issued accounting standardsin may 2015, the financial accounting standards board (‚Äúfasb‚Äù) issued asu 2015-07: fair value measurement (topic 820): disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent) (a consensus of the emerging issues task force). the new guidance eliminates the requirement to classify in the fair value hierarchy any investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient. this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03: interest-imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in asu 2015-03 require a reporting entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments.the amendments in asu 2015-03 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and are to be applied retrospectively. as of june30, 2015, the company had $626 of debt issuance costs that were included in other assets. these costs will be reclassified to reduce the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the effective date.- 9 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-14, receivables - troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-14 require a reporting entity to de-recognize a mortgage loan and recognize a separate other receivable upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met. upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor. the amendments in asu no. 2014-14 were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-14 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-11, transfers and servicing (topic 860).  the amendments in asu 2014-11 change the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. the guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. asu 2014-11 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-11 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 provide a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu no. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is allowed. adoption of asu no. 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables‚Äîtroubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-04 clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. the amendments in asu 2014-04 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-04 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-01, investments‚Äîequity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. the amendments in asu 2014-01 permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). the amendments in asu 2014-01 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-01 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. note b ‚Äì per share resultsbasic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common stock options and warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the company. basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below.- 10 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)three months ended june 30,six months

merger agreement. at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of

company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.the piedmont phantom equity plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, was assumed by the company in the mergers. a total of 856,447 shares of yadkin‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont shareholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist was issued to a rabbi trust established by yadkin to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock. at the time of the mergers, 28,405 shares of yadkin's series t and t-acb preferred stock were assumed by the company. the series t and t-acb preferred stock rank equally and have identical terms. they have no maturity date and pay cumulative dividends of 9.0 percent annually. the company redeemed the series t and t-acb preferred stock in the second quarter of 2015. yadkin issued 17.3 million shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represented approximately 55 percent of the voting interests in the company at the time of the mergers. guidance in fasb asc 805-40-30-2 explains that the purchase price in a reverse merger is determined based on the number of equity interests the legal acquiree would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal acquirer the same equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. the first step in estimating the purchase price in the mergers is to determine the ownership of the combined institution following the mergers. the table below summarizes, for each shareholder group immediately prior to the mergers, the ownership of yadkin common stock immediately following the mergers as well as the market capitalization of the combined institution using yadkin‚Äôs stock price at the time of the mergers. - 11 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)yadkin financial corporation ownership and market value

adjustments(a) adjustment reflects opening fair value of securities portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio.(b) adjustment reflects the elimination of yadkin's historical allowance for loan losses of $16,449 and the recording of a fair value discount of $47,189 on the loan portfolio. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(c) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on certain acquired branch offices as well as certain software and computer equipment. (d) adjustment reflects the write down of certain foreclosed assets based on current estimates of property values given current market conditions and additional discounts based on the company's planned disposition strategy. (e) adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments.(f) goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets.(g) adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. (h) adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include mortgage servicing assets, certain unusable prepaid expenses, and the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans. (i) adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. (j) adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for subordinated debt issued to fund trust preferred securities and long-term federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, which were calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for similar instruments. for fhlb advances, the fair value adjustment is consistent with the prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.(k) adjustments reflect accruals and fair value adjustments for other liabilities, which include the write-off of unearned income, deferred gains, and accrued liabilities that will not be paid. (l) no fair value adjustments were made to yadkin's outstanding preferred stock. the acquisition date preferred dividend rate of 9.0 percent approximated the then-current market yield for issuances of similar perpetual preferred stock. the preferred stock was redeemable at the liquidation value on the acquisition date, and the company expected the remaining life of the preferred stock would be relatively short. (m) the fair value of the common stock warrants was estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model assuming all 91,178 warrants will remain outstanding through expiration on july24, 2019. assumptions and inputs used in the option pricing model included stock price volatility of 48.6 percent, no dividends, a risk free interest rate of 1.74 percent, and an exercise price of $21.90 per common warrant.(n) amount reflects adjustments to goodwill resulting from adjustments (o), (p) and (q).(o) amount reflects an adjustment to estimated fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. - 13 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)(p) amount reflects adjustments to acquired deferred tax assets and the tax impact of adjustments (o) and (q).(q) amount reflects the adjustment of change in control obligations existing under various employment agreements that were triggered by the mergers, an increase in reserves for unfunded letters of credit, and additional accruals for certain legal matters and other liabilities. supplemental pro forma informationthe table below presents supplemental pro forma information as if the mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was january 1, 2014. pro forma results include adjustments

position110111as of june30, 2015, 54 securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than a twelve month period. the company had $108 thousand in gross unrealized losses on one corporate bond that had been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months as of june30, 2015. this was the only security in a loss position for this period of time that was not issued or guaranteed by a u.s. government agency or gse. based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for this corporate issuer, the company does not believe the unrealized loss on this bond was due to credit events.the securities in an unrealized loss position as of june30, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of june30, 2015. as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company held no individual investment securities with an aggregate book value

is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine the alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. - 19 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)in the second quarter of 2015, the company enhanced its alll methodology by transitioning to the pd/lgd approach to calculating historical loss rates by loan grouping, as previously described. in prior periods, the company calculated historical loss rates by loan type and then weighted these loss rates across its risk grade scale. both methods use historical loss rates to calculate reserves on loans evaluated collectively for impairment, but the company believes the enhanced pd/lgd approach provides a more precise and consistent estimate of loan losses across the risk grade scale based on actual default data. the enhanced alll calculation did not have a material impact on the total alll as of june 30, 2015 or on the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2015, however, the enhanced alll methodology did change the allocation of alll across certain loan classes, particularly commercial and industrial and construction loans. the company held other significant inputs into the alll model consistent, such as the "lookback" period used to develop historical loss rates, the loan groupings for collective evaluation, and the application of qualitative factors. there were also no changes to the company's evaluation of individually impaired loans.the company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. the company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings:‚Ä¢pass.  these loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted.‚Ä¢special mention. loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. loans where adverse economic conditions have developed that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt, but substantially increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating.‚Ä¢substandard.  loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.‚Ä¢doubtful.  loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.- 20 -yadkin financial

borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties. these modifications are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ("tdrs"). tdrs are evaluated individually for impairment based on the collateral value, if the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or discounted expected cash flows, if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. the company has no commitments to lend additional funds to any borrowers that have had a loan modified in a tdr. the following table provides the number and recorded investment of tdrs outstanding.- 23 -yadkin financial

retains the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold to its investors. the unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors was $510,232 and $455,033 as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. mortgage servicing rights ("msrs") are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. msrs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $308 and $602, respectively, in the three and six months ended june30, 2015. - 24 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following table summarizes msr activity for the 2015 periods presented. the company did not retain mortgage servicing on loans sold during the comparable periods of 2014.three months ended june 30, 2015six months ended june 30, 2015balance at beginning of period before valuation

of period after valuation allowance$4,652$4,652msrs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans, and impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. if impairment exists at the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table.the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msrs. generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the msr. measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.the characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table.june

hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. also, in the preceding table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs is calculated without changing any other assumptions. frequently, changes in one factor would  result in another factor changing, which would magnify or contract the effect of the change.- 25 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)sba-guaranteed loan servicing the company retains the servicing rights on sba-guaranteed loans sold to investors. the standard sale structure under the sba secondary participation guaranty agreement provides for the company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. the unpaid principal balance of sba-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was $179,096 and $136,093 as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. sba-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. sba servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. sba servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $413 and $251 for the three months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $785 and $443 for the six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the table below summarizes the activity in the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset for the periods

of period$3,9362,499$3,936$2,499the fair value of the servicing asset is compared to the amortized basis when certain triggering events occur. if the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against sba income. there was no valuation allowance recorded on the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of june30, 2015 or december31, 2014.note g ‚Äì commitments and contingenciesthe company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the company has in particular classes of financial instruments. the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. the company evaluates each customer‚Äôs creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit.the following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the company‚Äôs exposure to off-balance sheet commitments.june30, 2015december31, 2014lending commitments:commitments to extend credit$740,734$658,925commercial letters of

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note h ‚Äì derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. these instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income ("oci") for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives. interest rate swapsin 2013 and 2014, the company entered into six different forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $175,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.in august 2014, the company entered into two additional forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted brokered money market deposits to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in one-month libor, which is the underlying index of the brokered money market deposits. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps began to exchange one-month libor, plus the applicable spread, with fixed interest rates. the brokered money market accounts are expected to maintain at least $50,000 on deposit with the company through the maturity of the interest rate swaps. in march 2015, the company restructured certain of its derivative positions by terminating four interest rate swaps prior to their effective start dates and entering into two new forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates of 2.540 and 2.576 percent. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.the interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 30, 2015 are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table

term loan and on $8,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to crescent financial capital trust i, an unconsolidated trust formed to issue trust preferred securities ("trups"). in august 2014, the company also purchased separate interest rate cap contracts on $25,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to yadkin valley statutory trust i and on $10,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to american community capital trust. the underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month libor. in the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate. these interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key terms of each interest rate cap.interest rate capnotional amounteffective start datematurity datestrike rateunderlying index of

company enters into interest rate lock commitments with customers and commitments to sell mortgages to investors. the forward sale commitments are entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. these derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. the fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.the following table summarizes the balance sheet location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments grouped by the underlying hedged

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note i ‚Äì fair value measurementsfair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy. the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.investment securities. securities available for sale ("afs") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurements are based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, third-party pricing sources are generally utilized to determine fair value. these fair values are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. level 1 securities include securities traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, or sba-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. level 2 securities include gse securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. level 3 securities include certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented. three months ended june 30,six months ended june 30,2015201420152014level 3 afs

period$11,403$6,793$11,403$6,793sba-guaranteed loans. the company has elected to account for certain sba-guaranteed loans at fair value on a recurring basis. generally, the company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. the unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring level 2.derivatives. derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. currently outstanding derivatives, except for mortgage interest rate lock commitments described below, are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.mortgage loan commitments. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 3. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented. three months ended june 30,six months ended june 30,2015201420152014interest rate lock

sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 2. the difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations.- 29 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)loans. loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. however, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. the fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. for impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. when the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring level 2. when an appraised value is not available, or the company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring level 3.foreclosed assets. foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to foreclosed assets. subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management‚Äôs estimation of the value of the collateral. given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the company classifies foreclosed assets as nonrecurring level 3.the following tables summarize fair value information for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring and nonrecurring basis.totallevel1level 2level 3june 30, 2015measured at fair value on a recurring basis:securities available for sale:gse

unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company‚Äôs interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company‚Äôs mortgage banking department.due to the nature of the company‚Äôs business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. the fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. in addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company taken as a whole.cash and cash equivalents. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are a reasonable estimate of fair value.investment securities available for sale. a description of fair value estimates for securities available for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.investment securities held to maturity. the fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. these securities are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs.loans held for sale. the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market. a description of fair value estimates for sba-guaranteed loans held for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.loans. expected cash flows are forecasted over the remaining life of each loan and are discounted to present value at current market interest rates for similar loans considering loan collateral type and credit quality.federal home loan bank stock. given the option to redeem this stock at par through the fhlb, the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value.- 31 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)purchased accounts receivable. purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value, which is the same as the discounted purchase price, and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.deposits. the fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and now accounts represents the amount payable on demand. the fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities.short-term borrowings and long-term debt. the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at which borrowings of similar maturity could be obtained.accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable. the carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.derivative instruments. a description of fair value estimates for derivative instruments is included in the recurring fair value measurements section

condition and results of operationsyadkin financial corporation (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù or ‚Äúyadkin‚Äù) is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of north carolina and headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. the company conducts its business operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank, a full-service state-chartered community bank with 71 branches across north carolina and upstate south carolina.yadkin bank provides banking, mortgage, investment and insurance services to businesses and consumers across the carolinas.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company. this discussion and analysis includes descriptions of significant transactions, trends and other factors affecting the company‚Äôs operating results for the three- and six- month periods ended june30, 2015, and 2014, as well as the financial condition of the company as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.mergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù) and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company has completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.executive summarythe following is a summary of the company‚Äôs financial highlights and significant events in the second quarter of 2015:‚Ä¢net income available to common shareholders totaled $10.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in q2 2015, which was a significant improvement from $1.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in q2 2014.‚Ä¢net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain non-operating items, totaled  $11.9 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in q2 2015 compared to $2.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in q2 2014. ‚Ä¢operating return on average assets equaled 1.14 percent in q2 2015 while operating return on average tangible common equity equaled 12.83 percent.‚Ä¢operating efficiency, which represents operating expenses to total operating revenues, improved to 60.0 percent in q2 2015 from 66.3 percent in q2 2014.‚Ä¢net charge-offs increased to $920 thousand, or an annualized 0.12 percent of average loans, in q2 2015, from $226 thousand, or an annualized 0.20 percent of average loans, in q2 2014. ‚Ä¢annualized net loan growth was 5.8 percent in q2 2015, resulting from loan originations and commitments in the quarter of $389.6 million. - 34 -‚Ä¢the company continued implementation of expense reduction and branch optimization plans that included the elimination of certain back office positions and will result in the sale or closure of six branches in q3 and q4 2015.‚Ä¢during may, the company redeemed $28.4 million of preferred stock that had initially been issued in connection with the tarp capital purchase program. redemption of the preferred stock is expected to improve annual pre-tax earnings by $2.6 million and is expected to increase fully-diluted net income available to common shareholders by $0.08 per common share annually. non-gaap financial measuresstatements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-gaap financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures. the company's management uses these non-gaap financial measures, including: (i) net operating earnings available to common shareholders; (ii) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, (iii) operating non-interest income, (iv) operating non-interest expense, (v) operating efficiency ratio, (vi) adjusted allowance for loan losses to loans; and (vii) tangible common equity, in its analysis of the company's performance. the adjusted allowance for loan losses non-gaap reconciliation is presented within the allowance for loan losses section below. the tangible common equity non-gaap reconciliations, which include tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, are presented within the capital section below.management believes that non-gaap financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company without regard to transactional activities.non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under gaap, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under gaap and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company.non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under gaap. - 35 -three months ended june 30,six months ended june 30,(dollars in thousands, except per share

earnings increased to $38.2 million in the first six months of 2015 from $15.4 million in the same period of 2014.as discussed in greater detail below, the improvements in the results of operations in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, compared to the respective periods of 2014, reflect the benefit of significant operating leverage provided by the mergers. the balance sheet growth and customer base expansion have resulted in improved net interest income and non-interest income, while the company continues efforts to benefit from elimination of duplicative functions. net interest income q2 2015 compared to q2 2014net interest income improved to $39.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. the increase in net interest income was the result of a significant increase in interest-earning assets from the mergers, organic business activity, and an improved net interest margin. average interest-earning assets increased from $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2014 to $3.70 billion in the second quarter of 2015. over this period, average loan balances increased by $1.58 billion, of which $1.39 billion was from acquired yadkin loans, and average investment securities increased by $275.8 million, of which $257.7 million was from acquired yadkin investments. in addition, average deposits increased by $1.57 billion, of which $1.51 billion was from acquired yadkin deposits.the company's net interest margin expanded from 4.12 percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 4.29 percent in the second quarter of 2015. the improved net interest margin was due to an improved mix of interest-earning assets, a higher taxable-equivalent yield on investment securities, and an improved funding mix. net interest margin improvement was partially offset by lower loan yields, which were negatively impacted by proportionally lower accretion income, interest rate pressure, and stiff competition for loans from other financial institutions. the aggregate yield on interest-earning assets, which benefited from an improved interest-earning asset mix and higher investment yields, increased from 4.72 percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 4.83 percent in the second quarter of 2015. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined from 0.67 percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 0.65 percent in the second quarter of 2015, which primarily reflected lower deposit costs from the addition of the yadkin deposit base.net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2015, which consisted of $812 thousand of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired (‚Äúpci‚Äù) loans and $3.3 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the second quarter of 2014 totaled $2.9 million, which included $925 thousand of net accretion on pci loans and $2.0 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $1.5 million of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2014.- 37 -the following table summarizes the major components of net interest income and the related yields and costs for the quarterly periods presented.three months ended june 30, 2015three months

provision for loan losses reflected higher provision expense on non-pci loans, net of lower provision expense on pci loans. provision expense on non-pci loans increased due to higher net charge-offs and loan growth. net charge-offs represented an annualized 0.12 percent of average loans in the second quarter of 2015 compared to an annualized 0.07 percent of average loans in the second quarter of 2014. loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. if the company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. - 41 -if there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the company will first reverse any

operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from $33.0 million in the first six months of 2014 to $59.9 million in the first six months of 2015. due to the operating leverage resulting from balance sheet growth, the company's operating efficiency ratio improved from 68.2 percent in the first six months of 2014 to 61.1 percent in the first six months of 2015.lower merger and conversion costs partially offset higher non-interest expenses in the quarter. merger and conversion costs included professional fees, severance, technology, rebranding, and branch network expenses necessary to complete the mergers and related system conversions. restructuring charges of $3.2 million in the first six months of 2015 related to recognition of an obligation to a former executive officer and severance costs associated with the company's expense reduction and branch optimization plan. these plans resulted in the elimination of certain back office positions and include the planned closing or sale of six branches scheduled to occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. restructuring charges of $929 thousand in the first six months of 2014 related to an earlier branch optimization plan and efforts to streamline the company's organizational structure in certain back office functions following vantagesouth's 2013 acquisition of ecb. income taxesincome tax expense was $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. the company's effective tax rate improved to 36.1 percent in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014. the effective tax rate for the six-month period ended june30, 2015 was 36.2 percent compared to 43.5 percent for the six-month period ended june30, 2014. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to significant non-deductible merger expenses recorded in advance of the mergers. in 2013, north carolina had enacted tax reform that established statutory corporate income tax rate reductions from 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2014 and down to 5.0 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2015 followed by two additional rate reductions that are contingent upon the amount of net general fund tax collections.specifically, the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 4 percent for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2016, if tax collections in fiscal year 2014-2015 for the state exceed $20.2 billion.based on a press release from the governor's office on july 28, 2015, the statutory general fund tax collections threshold appears to have been met to allow for the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 4 percent for tax years beginning on january 1, 2016. the company revalues its deferred tax assets when an income tax rate is deemed to have been legally enacted. therefore, the company estimates that it will book a charge to income tax expense of approximately $700 thousand in the third quarter of 2015 to reflect the revaluation of its state deferred tax assets due to the state income tax rate reduction to 4 percent.analysis of financial conditioninvestment activitiesthe company's investment portfolio plays a major role in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity and, therefore, is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet. in general, the primary goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds as prescribed by law and other borrowings; (iii) to provide structures and terms to enable proper interest rate risk management; and (iv) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i), (ii) and (iii). the company invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations and its investment policy. these securities include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, u.s. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of state or political subdivisions, privately-issued residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible corporate bonds, limited types of mutual funds, and equity securities.- 44 -the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio was $653.0

portfolio has declined year-to-date in 2015 as the company has used principal cash flows from the securities portfolio to partially fund loan growth.marketable investment securities accounted for as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to accumulated other comprehensive income. the investment securities portfolio as of june30, 2015 consisted of u.s. government-sponsored enterprise ("gse") obligations, securities guaranteed by the sba, mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, corporate bonds, non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, non-taxable municipal bonds, and equity securities of certain financial institutions. as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had $2.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of unrealized gains and $6.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of unrealized losses. the securities in an unrealized loss position as of june30, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of june30, 2015. the following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio.june 30, 2015december31, 2014(dollars in

primary goal of the company's lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the company. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. in this context, the company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality.the company provides a wide range of business and consumer loans in the markets it serves. its objective is to have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio of business and consumer loans. in order to manage loan portfolio risk, the company has established concentration limits by borrower, product type, loan structure, and industry. the majority of business loans are secured by business assets and real estate supported in most cases by personal guarantees. consumer loans are primarily secured with personal assets and real estate. underwriting is primarily focused on the underlying cash flow of the business or consumer and secondarily on assets securing the loans.  loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled $2.96 billion as of june30, 2015, which was an increase of $57.5 million from december31, 2014, or a 5.8 percent annual growth rate. the table below provides a summary of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio by loan type.- 46 -composition of loan portfolio:june 30, 2015december 31,

life of each loan and then discounting those cash flows based on market rates for similar loans at the time of initial recognition. because acquired loans are marked to fair value and the legacy allowance for loan losses is eliminated at acquisition, the company believes an analysis of the loan portfolio carrying value and unpaid borrower principal balances ("upb") is useful in evaluating the

maturities are presented based on the final contractual maturity of each loan and do not reflect contractual principal payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans.- 47 -loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. where possible, pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. for pci loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the pci loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for pci loans and not to contractual interest payments. the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. the recorded investment in pci loans as of june30, 2015 totaled $169.4 million, of which $168.7 million were grouped into pools and $750 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis. the recorded investment in pci loans as of december31, 2014 totaled $206.1 million, of which $205.4 million were grouped into pools and $712 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis.due to the significance of the acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, the company's current period credit metrics and ratios may not be comparable to those in prior periods or to credit metrics and ratios other financial institutions. specifically, the current period (i) alll to total loans, (ii) alll to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions.nonperforming assetsloans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.  pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. these loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the company's pci loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. however, pci loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. the past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. in the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense.- 48 -loans, excluding pooled pci loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (‚Äútdr‚Äù) by the company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. the company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. the company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. the company‚Äôs policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a tdr follows relevant supervisory guidance. that is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. if a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. the company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.pci loans that were classified as tdrs prior to acquisition are not classified as tdrs by the company after the acquisition date. subsequent modification of a pci loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a tdr is not reported, or accounted for, as a tdr since pooled pci loans are excluded from the scope of tdr accounting. a pci loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a tdr if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a tdr after the acquisition date.nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.10 percent as of june30, 2015 compared to 0.92 percent as of december31, 2014 and 1.53 percent as of june30, 2014. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.06 percent as of june30, 2015 compared to 0.93 percent as of december31, 2014 and 1.44 percent as of june30, 2014. acquired pci loans that are included in loan pools, including acquired yadkin pci loans, are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. the following table summarizes the company's nonperforming

methodology primarily relates to non-pci loans. the evaluation of pci loans for impairment follows a different methodology which is described above. the alll is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. balances are charged against the alll when the collectability of principal is unlikely. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the alll. the alll is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. management evaluates the adequacy of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. for non-pci loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of the alll includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. for loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd") for each loan grouping. pds represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and lgds represent the estimated magnitude of loss the company will incur if a loan defaults. a loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. these historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine the alll reserve rates for each loan grouping. qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the alll calculation. in the second quarter of 2015, the company enhanced its alll methodology by transitioning to the pd/lgd approach to calculating historical loss rates by loan grouping, as previously described. in prior periods, the company calculated historical loss rates by loan type and then weighted these loss rates across its risk grade scale. both methods use historical loss rates to calculate reserves on loans evaluated collectively for impairment, but the company believes the current pd/lgd approach provides a more precise estimate of loan losses across the risk grade scale based on actual default data. the enhanced alll calculation did not have a material impact on the total alll as of june30, 2015 or on the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2015, however, the enhanced alll methodology did change the allocation of alll across certain loan classes, particularly commercial and industrial and construction and development loans. the company held other significant inputs into the alll model consistent, such as the "lookback" period used to develop historical loss rates, loan groupings for collective evaluation, and the application of qualitative factors.a loan, excluding pci loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. pci loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment.the following table presents the allocation of the alll for the periods presented.june 30, 2015december31, 2014(dollars in thousands)amount%oftotalallowanceamount%oftotalallowancecommercial:commercial real

alll calculation, current changes in the composition of the loan portfolio also contributed to changes in alll balances by loan class. among non-pci loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans increased $91.7 million and $32.2 million, respectively, from december31, 2014, to june30, 2015. commercial construction loans declined $37.0 million during the same period, as construction loans were either repaid or transferred to another loan class when the construction project ended and the permanent financing phase began. the reduction in outstanding commercial construction loans included a $2.5 million or 66.2% reduction in balances identified as nonperforming. the following table summarizes changes in the alll

well as net acquisition fair value adjustments for acquired loans, declined from 2.17 percent of total loans as of december31, 2014 to 1.88 percent of total loans as of june30, 2015. the reduction in adjusted alll resulted primarily from lower loss rates used in the alll model due to improvement in charge-off levels and continued accretion of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. the

and investing activities. the company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, iras and cds. these accounts generally earn interest at rates the company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. the establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. while the company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. as of june30, 2015, brokered deposits represented 10.3 percent of total deposits.total deposits as of june30, 2015 were $3.24 billion, which was a decrease of $4.3 million from december31, 2014. as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company had outstanding time deposits under $100 thousand of $556.0 million and $547.5 million, respectively, and time deposits over $100 thousand of $521.9 million and $544.8 million, respectively.the table below provides a

offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. the average cost of deposits was 0.38 percent in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 0.40 percent in the second quarter of 2014 due to changes in deposit mix and lower deposit interest rates. - 52 -borrowings and long-term debtthe company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. short-term borrowings totaled $355.5 million and $250.5 million as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively, and consisted of fhlb advances maturing within twelve months. the balance of short-term fhlb advances increased during the year-to-date period to partially fund loan growth and to compensate for the preferred stock redemption. the company also shifted some its maturities from long-term to short-term as the mix of loan originations and loans in the pipeline continue to be weighted towards variable rate lending.long-term debt totaled $147.3 million as of june30, 2015, which was a decrease from $180.2 million as of december31, 2014. long-term debt included outstanding long-term fhlb advances of $71.5 million and $104.7 million as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. long-term debt also included $7.1 million in a subordinated term loan due in 2018 as well as $38.1 million in fixed rate subordinated notes due in 2023. as of june30, 2015, long-term debt also included a total of $24.7 million in junior subordinated debentures issued to various unconsolidated trusts which were formed to issue trust preferred securities. this amount grew from a balance of $24.4 million as of december31, 2014 due to accretion of fair value discounts related to the trust preferred securities. capital lease obligations, which are included in long-term debt, totaled $5.9 million and  $6.0 million as of june30, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.shareholders‚Äô equitytotal shareholders‚Äô equity was $548.1 million as of june30, 2015, which was a decrease of $9.7 million from december31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the preferred stock redemption of $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, a $1.7 million net other comprehensive loss, and $821 thousand of dividends paid on preferred stock prior to the redemption. the decrease was partially offset by $21.0 million of year-to-date 2015 net income.liquidityliquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. the company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the board of directors. investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, available borrowings from the fhlb, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the bank. the primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases. the primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are common stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and trups, and operating expenses. the primary sources of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the bank. in addition, on july 2, 2014, the holding company entered into a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at libor plus 4.0 percent. the loan agreement will expire on july 1, 2016. however, the company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. the obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the bank.as of june30, 2015, the company's most liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities available for sale) totaled $772.0 million, which represented 18 percent of total assets and 24 percent of total deposits. supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the company had available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of secured and unsecured lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled $367.2 million as of june30, 2015. as of june30, 2015, outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled $758.9 million, standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb on the bank's behalf totaled $10.0 million, and outstanding capital commitments to a private investment fund were $2.7 million. management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded $3.46 billion, or 80 percent, of total assets as of june30, 2015, compared to $3.50 billion or 82 percent of total assets as of december31, 2014.- 53 -contractual obligationsthe following table

maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. the company's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the company's risk profile, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to shareholders.   on july2, 2013, the federal reserve board, and on july9, 2013, the fdic, adopted a final rule that implements the basel iii changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the ‚Äúbasel iii rules.‚Äù the basel iii rules apply to both depository institutions and their holding companies. the basel iii rules, which became effective for both the company and the bank on january 1, 2015, include new risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements which refine the definition of what constitutes ‚Äúcapital‚Äù for purposes of calculating those ratios. the minimum capital level requirements applicable to the company and the bank under the basel iii rules are: (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from 4 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent for all institutions. common equity tier 1 capital will consist of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments. the basel iii rules also establish a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù of 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. the conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, result in the following minimum ratios: (i)a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. the new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in january 2016 at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january 2019. an institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.the basel iii rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. the prompt corrective action rules were modified to include a common equity tier 1 capital component and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. for example, under the proposed prompt corrective action rules, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as ‚Äúwell capitalized:‚Äù (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (increased from 6 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent (unchanged from current rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 percent (unchanged from previous rules). the basel iii rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. - 54 -the company's and the

-forward-looking informationthis periodic report on form 10-q contains certain ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù that represent management‚Äôs judgments concerning the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company‚Äôs actual operating results and financial position to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ‚Äúmay,‚Äù ‚Äúwill,‚Äù ‚Äúanticipate,‚Äù ‚Äúshould,‚Äù ‚Äúwould,‚Äù ‚Äúproject,‚Äù ‚Äúfuture,‚Äù ‚Äústrategy,‚Äù

influence the estimates include risks associated with any change in management, strategic direction, business plan, or operations, our management‚Äôs ability to successfully integrate the company‚Äôs business and execute its business plan across new and diverse markets in north carolina, south carolina and elsewhere, greater than expected costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired companies, local economic conditions affecting retail and commercial real estate, disruptions in the credit markets, particularly in light of continued economic uncertainty in the european union, continued political unrest and instability in the middle east; changes in interest rates, adverse developments in the real estate market affecting the value and marketability of collateral securing loans made by the bank, the failure of assumptions underlying loan loss and other reserves, competition and the risk of new and changing regulation, including, but not limited to recent proposals that would change capital standards and asset risk-weighting for financial institutions. additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company‚Äôs filings with the securities and exchange commission, including without limitation previous annual reports on form 10-k of the company and of predecessor companies. the forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date hereof, and the company does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as may otherwise be required by law.item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. like many financial institutions, the company‚Äôs most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. this goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. the goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. the company's overall interest rate risk position is governed by policies approved by the board of directors and guidelines established and monitored by the bank‚Äôs asset/liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù).  to measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("nii") at risk, which measures the impact on nii over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("eve"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. nii at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on nii. eve is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the company's balance sheet, or equity. gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measure of the company's interest rate risk position. all of these models are subject to alco guidelines and are monitored regularly.in calculating nii at risk, the company begins with a base amount of nii that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. the current yield curve is then ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or moved immediately, ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. new twelve-month and twenty four-month nii projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. the company also models other scenarios to evaluate potential nii at risk such as a gradual ramp in interest rates, a flattening yield curve, a steepening yield curve, and others that management deems appropriate.eve at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. the present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. the company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values.key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. these assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future nii or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nii and eve. actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. projections of nii are assessed as part of the company's forecasting process.- 56 -nii and eve analysis.  the following table presents the estimated exposure to nii for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to eve due to immediate changes in interest rates. all information is presented as of june30, 2015.june30, 2015(dollars in thousands)estimated exposure to niiestimated exposure to eveimmediate change in interest rates:+ 4.0%12.75%5.65%+ 3.0%9.324.61+ 2.0%4.973.35+ 1.0%1.301.79no change‚Äî‚Äî- 1.0%(1.38)(3.53)while the measures presented in the table above are not a prediction of future nii or eve valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher nii in the short term. other important factors that impact the levels of nii are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.item 4. controls and proceduresthe company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), as of june30, 2015. based on that evaluation, the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company‚Äôs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.there were no changes in the company‚Äôs internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal controls over financial reporting.- 57 -part ii.  other informationitem 1. legal proceedingsthe company and yadkin bank have been named defendants in legal actions arising from normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed. although the amount of any unrecorded liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any additional liability arising from these matters will not have a material effect on yadkin's consolidated financial statements.item 1a. risk

in thousands, except per share amounts)note a ‚Äì basis of presentation and significant accounting policiesthe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation (the "company" or "yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank. yadkin is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of north carolina and headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. yadkin, which was formed in 2006, conducts its business operations primarily through yadkin bank. yadkin bank is a north carolina chartered community bank providing banking and financial services in 73 branches across north carolina and upstate south carolina. the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of  the company's 2014 form 10-k. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. results of operations for the three months ended march31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending december 31, 2015. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. ("vantagesouth") and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. ("piedmont"), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of yadkin at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont. financial results of the company following the mergers reflect balances of the combined organization. as required under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers. recently adopted and issued accounting standardsin april 2015, the financial accounting standards board (‚Äúfasb‚Äù) issued asu 2015-03: interest-imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in asu 2015-03 require a reporting entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments. the amendments in asu 2015-03 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015, for public companies, and is to be applied retrospectively. early adoption is permitted. adoption of asu 2015-03 is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-14, receivables - troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-14 require a reporting entity to derecognize a mortgage loan and recognize a separate other receivable upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met. upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor. the amendments in asu no. 2014-14 were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-14 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. - 9 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-11, transfers and servicing (topic 860).  the amendments in asu 2014-11 change the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. the guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. asu 2014-11 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-11 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 provide a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu no. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. adoption of asu no. 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables‚Äîtroubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in asu 2014-04 clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. the amendments in asu 2014-04 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of asu 2014-04 did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-01, investments‚Äîequity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. the amendments in asu 2014-01 permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). the amendments in asu 2014-01 were effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. note b ‚Äì per share resultsbasic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common stock options and warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the company. basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below.three months

mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont pursuant to the merger agreement. at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers were recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.the piedmont phantom equity plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, was assumed by the company in the mergers. a total of 856,447 shares of yadkin‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont shareholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist was issued to a rabbi trust established by yadkin to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock. from an accounting perspective, 28,405 shares of yadkin's series t and t-acb preferred stock were assumed by the company in the mergers. the series t and t-acb preferred stock rank equally and have identical terms. they have no maturity date and pay cumulative dividends of 9.0 percent annually. the company has received approval from appropriate regulatory authorities to  redeem the series t and t-acb preferred stock and anticipates completing that redemption during the second quarter of 2015. yadkin issued 17.3 million shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represented approximately 55 percent of the voting interests in the company at the time of the mergers. guidance in fasb asc 805-40-30-2 explains that the purchase price in a reverse merger is determined "based on the number of equity interests the legal [acquiree] would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal [acquirer] the same equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition." the first step in estimating the purchase price in the mergers is to determine the ownership of the combined institution following the mergers. the table below summarizes, for each shareholder group immediately prior to the mergers, the ownership of yadkin common stock immediately following the mergers as well as the market capitalization of the combined institution using yadkin‚Äôs stock price at the time of the mergers. yadkin financial

except per share amounts)explanation of fair value adjustments(a) adjustment reflects opening fair value of securities portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio.(b) adjustment reflects the elimination of yadkin's historical allowance for loan losses of $16.4 million and the recording of a fair value discount of $47.2 million on the loan portfolio. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(c) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on certain acquired branch offices as well as certain software and computer equipment. (d) adjustment reflects the write down of certain foreclosed assets based on current estimates of property values given current market conditions and additional discounts based on the company's planned disposition strategy. (e) adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments.(f) goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets.(g) adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. (h) adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include mortgage servicing assets, certain unusable prepaid expenses, and the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans. (i) adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. (j) adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for subordinated debt issued to fund trust preferred securities and long-term federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, which were calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for similar instruments. for fhlb advances, the fair value adjustment is consistent with the prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.(k) adjustments reflect accruals and fair value adjustments for other liabilities, which include the write-off of unearned income, deferred gains, and accrued liabilities that will not be paid. (l) no fair value adjustments were made to yadkin's outstanding preferred stock. the acquisition date preferred dividend rate of 9.0 percent approximated the then-current market yield for issuances of similar perpetual preferred stock. the preferred stock was redeemable at the liquidation value on the acquisition date, and the company expected the remaining life of the preferred stock would be relatively short. (m) the fair value of the common stock warrants was estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model assuming all 91,178 warrants will remain outstanding through expiration on july24, 2019. assumptions and inputs used in the option pricing model included stock price volatility of 48.6 percent, no dividends, a risk free interest rate of 1.74 percent, and an exercise price of $21.90 per common warrant.(n) amount reflects adjustments to goodwill resulting from adjustments (o), (p) and (q).(o) amount reflects an adjustment to estimated fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. (p) amount reflects adjustments to acquired deferred tax assets and the tax impact of adjustments (o) and (p).(q) amount reflects the adjustment of change in control obligations existing under various employment agreements that were triggered by the mergers. supplemental pro forma informationthe table below presents supplemental pro forma information as if the mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was january 1, 2014. pro forma results include adjustments for amortization and accretion of fair value adjustments and do not include any projected cost savings or other anticipated benefits of the mergers. therefore, the pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred

bonds, 4 marketable equity securities, 1 gse obligation, and 1 non-agency residential mortgage-backed security. as of march31, 2015, 54 securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than a twelve month period. the company had $20 in gross unrealized losses on corporate bonds as of march31, 2015 that had been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months, which were the only securities in this position that were not issued or guaranteed by a u.s. government agency or gse. based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for these corporate issuers, the company does not believe the unrealized losses on these bonds were due to credit events. the securities in an unrealized loss position as of march31, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of march31, 2015. as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company held no individual investment securities with an aggregate book value greater than 10 percent of total shareholders‚Äô equity. as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, investment securities with carrying

information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. the company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings:‚Ä¢pass.  these loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted.‚Ä¢special mention. loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. loans where adverse economic conditions have developed that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt, but substantially increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating.‚Ä¢substandard.  loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.‚Ä¢doubtful.  loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.- 19 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following tables summarize the risk category

servicing rights on mortgage loans sold to its investors. the unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors was $473,575 and $455,033 as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. mortgage servicing rights ("msrs") are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. msrs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $293 in the three months ended march 31, 2015. the following table summarizes msr activity for the three months ended march 31, 2015. the company did not retain mortgage servicing

financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)msrs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans, and impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. if impairment exists at the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table.the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msrs. generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the msr. measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.the characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table.march 31, 2015december31, 2014composition of mortgage loans serviced for others:fixed rate loans99.88%99.86%adjustable rate loans0.12%0.14%total100.00%100.00%weighted average life

calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. also, in the preceding table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs is calculated without changing any other assumptions. frequently, changes in one factor would  result in another factor changing, which would magnify or contract the effect of the change.sba-guaranteed loan servicing the company retains the servicing rights on sba-guaranteed loans sold to investors. the standard sale structure under the sba secondary participation guaranty agreement provides for the company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. the unpaid principal balance of sba-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was $156,277 and $136,093 as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. sba-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. sba servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. sba servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $371 and $192 for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the table below summarizes the activity in the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset for

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the fair value of the servicing asset is compared to the amortized basis when certain triggering events occur. if the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against sba income. there was no valuation allowance recorded on the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of march31, 2015 or december31, 2014.note g ‚Äì commitments and contingenciesthe company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the company has in particular classes of financial instruments. the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. the company evaluates each customer‚Äôs creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit.the following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the company‚Äôs exposure to off-balance sheet commitments.march31, 2015december31, 2014lending

recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.note h ‚Äì derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. these instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income ("oci") for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives. interest rate swapsin 2013 and 2014, the company entered into six different forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $175,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.in august 2014, the company entered into two additional forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted brokered money market deposits to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in one-month libor, which is the underlying index of the brokered money market deposits. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps began to exchange one-month libor, plus the applicable spread, with fixed interest rates. each brokered money market account is expected to maintain at least $25,000 on deposit with the company through the maturity of the interest rate swaps. - 25 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)in march 2015, the company restructured certain of its derivative positions by terminating four interest rate swaps prior to their effective start dates and entering into two new forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted three-month fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective dates, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of interest on the fhlb advances with fixed interest rates of 2.540 and 2.576 percent. each three-month fhlb advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each swap.the interest rate swaps outstanding as of march 31, 2015 are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key

cap contracts on a $7,500 subordinated term loan and on $8,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to crescent financial capital trust i, an unconsolidated trust formed to issue trust preferred securities ("trups"). in august 2014, the company also purchased separate interest rate cap contracts on $25,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to yadkin valley statutory trust i and on $10,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to american community capital trust. the underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month libor. in the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate. these interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's earnings and economic value at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key terms of each interest rate cap.interest rate capnotional amounteffective start

lock commitments with customers and commitments to sell mortgages to investors. the forward sale commitments are entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. these derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. the fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.the following table summarizes the balance sheet location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments grouped by the underlying hedged instrument.march 31, 2015december31,

measurementsfair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy. the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.investment securities. securities available for sale ("afs") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurements are based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, third-party pricing sources are generally utilized to determine fair value. these fair values are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. level 1 securities include securities traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, or sba-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. level 2 securities include gse securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. level 3 securities include certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented. - 27 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)three months ended march 31,20152014level 3 afs securities at beginning of

account for certain sba-guaranteed loans at fair value on a recurring basis. generally, the company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. the unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring level 2.derivatives. derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. currently outstanding derivatives, except for mortgage interest rate lock commitments described below, are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.mortgage loan commitments. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 3. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented. three months ended march 31,20152014interest rate lock commitments at beginning of period$342$354issuances1,465328settlements(1,171)(351)interest rate lock commitments at end of period$636$331the fair value of forward sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 2. the difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations.loans. loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. however, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. the fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. for impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. when the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring level 2. when an appraised value is not available, or the company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring level 3.foreclosed assets. foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to foreclosed assets. subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management‚Äôs estimation of the value of the collateral. given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the company classifies foreclosed assets as nonrecurring level 3.- 28 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following

unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company‚Äôs interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company‚Äôs mortgage banking department.due to the nature of the company‚Äôs business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. the fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. in addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company taken as a whole.cash and cash equivalents. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are a reasonable estimate of fair value.investment securities available for sale. a description of fair value estimates for securities available for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.investment securities held to maturity. the fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. these securities are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs.loans held for sale. the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market. a description of fair value estimates for sba-guaranteed loans held for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.loans. expected cash flows are forecasted over the remaining life of each loan and are discounted to present value at current market interest rates for similar loans considering loan collateral type and

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)purchased accounts receivable. purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value, which is the same as the discounted purchase price, and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.deposits. the fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and now accounts represents the amount payable on demand. the fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities.short-term borrowings and long-term debt. the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at

‚Äúcompany‚Äù or ‚Äúyadkin‚Äù) is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of north carolina and headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. the company conducts its business operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank, a full-service state-chartered community bank with 73 branches across north carolina and upstate south carolina.yadkin bank provides banking, mortgage, investment and insurance services to businesses and consumers across the carolinas.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company. this discussion and analysis includes descriptions of significant transactions, trends and other factors affecting the company‚Äôs operating results for the three months ended march31, 2015, and 2014, as well as the financial condition of the company as of march31, 2015, and december31, 2014. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.mergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù) and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into yadkin, with yadkin continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of yadkin for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of yadkin; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company has substantially completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.executive summarythe following is a summary of the company‚Äôs financial highlights and significant events in the first quarter of 2015:‚Ä¢net income

transactional activities.non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under gaap, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under gaap and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company.non-gaap

share, in the first quarter of 2015, which was an increase from $1.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2014. net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2014. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $18.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2014.as discussed below, the improvements in the results of operations in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 reflect the benefit of significant operating leverage provided by the mergers. the balance sheet growth and customer base expansion have resulted in improved net interest income and non-interest income, while the company continues efforts to achieve the efficiencies resulting from elimination of duplicative functions. in the aggregate, the revenue growth in the first quarter of 2015 represents twice the growth in non-interest expense when compared to the pre-merger results for the first quarter of 2014. net interest income net interest income improved to $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2014. the increase in net interest income was the result of a significant increase in earning assets from the mergers, organic business activity, and an improved net interest margin. average earning assets increased from $1.86 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $3.69 billion in the first quarter of 2015. over this period, average loan balances increased by $1.52 billion, of which $1.39 billion was from acquired yadkin loans, and average investment securities increased by $291.0 million, of which $257.7 million was from acquired yadkin investments. in addition, average deposits increased by $1.53 billion, of which $1.51 billion was from acquired yadkin deposits.the company's net interest margin expanded from 4.19 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to 4.33 percent in the first quarter of 2015. the improved net interest margin was due to an improved mix of interest-earning assets, a higher taxable-equivalent yield on investment securities, and higher non-interest bearing deposit balances. net interest income improvement was partially offset by lower loan yields. loan yields were negatively impacted by proportionally lower accretion income and pricing pressure on loan originations from a combination of lower prevailing market interest rates and stiff competition for loans from other financial institutions. the aggregate yield on earning assets, which benefited from an improved earning asset mix and higher investment yields, increased from 4.79 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to 4.84 percent in the first quarter of 2015. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined from 0.68 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to 0.63 percent in the first quarter of 2015, which primarily reflected lower deposit costs from the addition of the yadkin deposit base.net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, which consisted of $1.5 million of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired (‚Äúpci‚Äù) loans and $2.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the first quarter of 2014 totaled $3.1 million, which included $1.1 million of net accretion on pci loans and $2.0 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $906 thousand of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $631 thousand in the first quarter of 2014.- 36 -the following table summarizes the major components of net interest income and the related yields and costs for the quarterly periods presented.three months ended march 31,

decrease in provision for loan losses reflected lower provision expense for non-pci loans, net of higher provision expense for pci loans. provision expense on non-pci loans decreased primarily due to lower net charge-offs, which decreased to 0.07 percent of average loans in the first quarter of 2015 from 0.32 percent of average loans in the first quarter of 2014. the $312 thousand pci provision credit in the prior year was due to the reversal of previously established reserves on certain commercial and residential real estate loan pools as cash flows improved in those pools.loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. if the company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. - 38 -if there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the company will first reverse any previously established alll and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans. events that would result in probable increases in expected cash flows include (i) increases in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming non-collateral dependent during the period for which there was an estimated collateral shortfall in prior estimations, (iii) actual cash flow collections in excess of prior estimates, and (iv) improvement in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors.results of the company‚Äôs cash flow re-estimation for pci loans in the first quarter of 2015 are summarized as follows.(dollars in thousands)provisionyield adjustmentprevious yieldnew

business lending income, which includes gains on sales of the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans originated by the company as well as servicing fees on previously sold sba loans, increased by $532 thousand due to a higher volume of loan originations and sales as the company has expanded its government lending presence into new markets. mortgage banking income increased by $1.0 million due

non-interest expense categories were all significantly impacted by the mergers which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the company's expense base. further, fdic deposit insurance premiums and intangible asset amortization were impacted by the acquired yadkin deposit base. operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from $17.0 million in the first quarter of 2014 to $29.8 million in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, the company's operating efficiency ratio improved from 70.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to 62.1 percent in the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to the significant scale and operating leverage provided by the mergers.lower merger and conversion costs partially offset higher non-interest expenses in the quarter. these costs included professional fees, severance, technology, rebranding, and branch network expenses necessary to complete the mergers and related system conversions. restructuring charges of $907 thousand in the first quarter of 2015 related to severance costs associated with the company's expense reduction and branch optimization plan which includes the elimination of twenty-five back office positions as well as the planned closing of six branches scheduled to occur in the third quarter of 2015. restructuring charges of $836 thousand in the first quarter of 2014 related to an earlier branch optimization plan and efforts to streamline the company's organizational structure in certain back office functions following vantagesouth's acquisition of ecb bancorp, inc. income taxesincome tax expense was $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2014. the company's effective tax rate improved to 36.3 percent in the first quarter of 2015 from 42.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014. this tax rate improvement was due to higher non-deductible merger expenses in the prior year quarter.analysis of financial conditioninvestment activitiesthe company's investment portfolio plays a major role in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity and, therefore, is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet. in general, the primary goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds as prescribed by law and other borrowings; (iii) to provide structures and terms to enable management to properly management interest rate risk on the balance sheet; and (iv) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i), (ii) and (iii). the company invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations and its investment policy. these securities include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, u.s. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, privately-issued residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible corporate bonds, limited types of mutual funds and equity securities.- 40 -the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio was $655.7 million and $658.3 million, respectively, as of march31, 2015 compared to $674.2 million and $672.4 million, respectively, as of december31, 2014. the amortized cost and fair value of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio was $39.5 million and $40.6 million, respectively, as of march31, 2015 compared to $39.6 million and $40.6 million, respectively, as of december31, 2014. the portfolio declined in the quarter as the company has used principal cash flows from the securities portfolio to partially fund loan growth. the company intends to continue reinvesting cash flows from the portfolio into loans throughout 2015.marketable investment securities accounted for as available for sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to accumulated other comprehensive income. the investment securities portfolio as of march31, 2015 consisted of u.s. government-sponsored enterprise ("gse") obligations, securities guaranteed by the u.s. small business administration ("sba"), mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, investment grade corporate bonds, investment grade non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, investment grade non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, investment grade non-taxable municipal bonds, and equity securities of certain financial institutions. as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had $4.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of unrealized gains and $2.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of unrealized losses. the securities in an unrealized loss position as of march31, 2015 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of march31, 2015. the following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio.march 31, 2015december31, 2014(dollars in

company's lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the company. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. in this context, the company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality.the company provides a wide range of business and consumer loans in the markets it serves. its objective is to have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio of business and consumer loans. in order to manage loan portfolio risk, the company has established concentration limits by borrower, product type, loan structure, and industry. the majority of business loans are secured by business assets and real estate supported in most cases by personal guarantees. consumer loans are primarily secured with personal assets and real estate. underwriting is primarily focused on the underlying cash flow of the business or consumer and secondarily on assets securing the loans.  - 42 -loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled $2.91 billion as of march31, 2015, which was an increase of $15.6 million since december31, 2014, a 2.2 percent annual growth rate. the composition of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio as of march31, 2015 was as follows: 47.2 percent in commercial real estate loans, 15.8 percent in commercial and industrial loans, 13.2 percent in commercial construction and land development loans, 12.2 percent in residential real estate loans, 1.0 percent in consumer construction and land development loans, 9.4 percent in home equity loans and lines of credit, and 1.2 percent in consumer loans. the composition of the loan portfolio as of december31, 2014 was as follows: 46.8 percent in commercial real estate loans, 16.2 percent in commercial and industrial loans, 12.8 percent in commercial construction and land development loans, 12.4 percent in residential real estate loans, 1.0 percent in consumer construction and land development loans, 9.5 percent in home equity loans and lines of credit, and 1.3 percent in consumer loans. for each acquired loan portfolio, the company made fair value adjustments by projecting expected future principal and interest cash flows over the remaining life of each loan and then discounting those cash flows based on market rates for similar loans at the time of initial recognition. because acquired loans are marked to fair value and the legacy allowance for loan losses is eliminated at acquisition, the company believes an analysis of the loan portfolio carrying value and unpaid borrower principal balances ("upb") is useful in evaluating the portfolio.the following table summarizes the upb and carrying amounts of the loan portfolio by

payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans.- 43 -loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. where possible, pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. for pci loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the pci loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for pci loans and not to contractual interest payments. the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. the recorded investment in pci loans as of march31, 2015 totaled $189.6 million, of which $188.9 million were grouped into pools and $710 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis. the recorded investment in pci loans as of december31, 2014 totaled $206.1 million, of which $205.4 million were grouped into pools and $712 thousand were accounted for on an individual loan basis.due to the significance of the company's acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, traditional credit ratios should not be used when comparing prior periods to the current period or when comparing the company to other financial institutions. specifically, the current period (i) alll to total loans, (ii) alll to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions.nonperforming assetsloans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.  pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. these loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the company's pci loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. however, pci loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. the past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. in the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense.loans, excluding pooled pci loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (‚Äútdr‚Äù) by the company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. the company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. the company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. the company‚Äôs policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a tdr follows relevant supervisory guidance. that is, if a borrower has - 44 -demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. if a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. the company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.pci loans that were classified as tdrs prior to acquisition are not classified as tdrs by the company after the acquisition date. subsequent modification of a pci loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a tdr is not reported, or accounted for, as a tdr since pooled pci loans are excluded from the scope of tdr accounting. a pci loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a tdr if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a tdr after the acquisition date.nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.29 percent as of march31, 2015 compared to 0.92 percent as of december31, 2014 and 1.51 percent as of march31, 2014. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.17 percent as of march31, 2015 compared to 0.93 percent as of december31, 2014 and 1.44 percent as of march31, 2014. acquired pci loans that are included in loan pools, including acquired yadkin pci loans, are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. the following table summarizes the company's nonperforming assets.(dollars in thousands)march31, 2015december31, 2014nonaccrual loans$26,841$17,949accruing loans past

loans$37,6301.29%$26,7590.92%allowance for loan lossesthe alll and related provision are calculated separately for pci loans and non-pci loans. the following description of the company's alll methodology primarily relates to non-pci loans. the evaluation of pci loans for impairment follows a different methodology which is described above. the alll is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. balances are charged against the alll when the collectability of principal is unlikely. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the alll. the alll is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. management evaluates the adequacy of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. - 45 -for non-pci loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of the alll includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. the determination of loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment involves considerations of historic loan loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors such as current delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition, prevailing economic conditions, the loan review function, and other relevant factors. as of march 31, 2015, the company used a trailing 3.75-year historical net charge-off rates in combination with the qualitative factors to determine appropriate loss rates for each identified risk category. the company had previously been utilizing a 3-year historical loan loss period to calculate its historical charge-off rates but modified its approach in the third quarter of 2014 to freeze the earliest quarter in the look-back period (q3 2011). the purpose of this change was to reflect the appropriate historical charge-off rate for the current credit cycle in the alll model. therefore, one quarter will be added to the historical look-back period until the model reaches 4 full years of historical losses.the company utilizes an internal grading system to assign the degree of inherent risk on each loan in the portfolio. the risk grade is initially assigned by the lending officer and reviewed by the credit administration function. the internal risk grading system is reviewed and tested periodically by the loan review function. the company's alll model uses the internal loan grading system to segment each category of loans by risk grade. calculated loss rates are weighted more heavily for higher risk loans.  a loan, excluding pci loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. pci loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment.the following table presents the

reduction in adjusted alll resulted primarily from lower loss rates used in the alll model due to improvement in charge-off levels and continued accretion of fair value adjustments. the following

investing activities. the company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, iras and cds. these accounts generally earn interest at rates the company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. the establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. while the company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. as of march31, 2015, brokered deposits represented approximately 8.6 percent of total deposits.total deposits as of march31, 2015 were $3.21 billion, which was a decrease of $38.2 million from december31, 2014. as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, the company had outstanding time deposits under $100 thousand of $535.3 million and $415.0 million, respectively, and time deposits over $100 thousand of $535.7 million and $677.8 million, respectively.- 47 -the composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of march31, 2015 was as follows: 33.4 percent in time deposits, 31.5 percent in money market and savings, 20.4 percent in non-interest bearing demand deposits, and 14.7 percent in interest-bearing demand deposits. the composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of december31, 2014 was as follows: 33.6 percent in time deposits, 30.9 percent in money market and savings, 21.0 percent in non-interest bearing demand deposits, and 14.5 percent in interest-bearing demand deposits. the following table summarizes the average balances outstanding and

with reductions in the percentage of deposits held in interest-bearing demand and time deposit accounts. the company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. the average cost of deposits was 0.36 percent in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 0.40 percent in the first quarter of 2014 due to changes in deposit mix and lower deposit interest rates. borrowings and long-term debtthe company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. short-term borrowings totaled $325.5 million and $250.5 million as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively, and consisted of fhlb advances maturing within twelve months. the balance of short-term fhlb advances increased during the quarter to partially fund loan growth and to compensate for the decline in deposit balances. the company also shifted some its maturities from long-term to short-term as the duration on the investment portfolio continues to decrease and as the mix of loans in the pipeline continue to be weighted towards variable rate lending.long-term debt totaled $137.2 million as of march31, 2015, which was a decrease from $180.2 million as of december31, 2014. the company had outstanding long-term fhlb advances of $61.6 million and $104.7 million as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively. as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, long-term debt included $7.1 million in a subordinated term loan due in 2018 as well as $38.1 million in fixed rate subordinated notes due in 2023. as of march31, 2015, long-term debt also included a total of $24.6 million in junior subordinated debentures issued to various unconsolidated trusts which were formed to issue trust preferred securities. this amount grew from a balance of $24.4 million as of december31, 2014 due to accretion of fair value discounts related to the trust preferred securities. capital lease obligations, which are included in long-term debt, totaled $5.9 million and  $6.0 million as of march31, 2015 and december31, 2014, respectively.shareholders‚Äô equitytotal shareholders‚Äô equity was $567.8 million as of march31, 2015, which was an increase of $10.0 million from december31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to net income of $10.3 million and other comprehensive income of $216 thousand. dividends on preferred stock of $639 thousand reduced shareholders' equity.liquidityliquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. the company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the board of directors. - 48 -investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, and available borrowings from the fhlb, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the bank. the primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases. the primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are preferred stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and trups, and operating expenses. the primary sources of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the bank. in addition, on july 2, 2014, the holding company entered into a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at libor plus 4.0 percent. the loan agreement will expire on july 1, 2015. however, the company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. the obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the bank.as of march31, 2015, the company's liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities available for sale) totaled $766.8 million, which represented 18 percent of total assets and 24 percent of total deposits. supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the company has available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled $391.7 million as of march31, 2015. as of march31, 2015, outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled $708.5 million, standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb on the bank's behalf totaled $10.0 million, and outstanding capital commitments to a private investment fund were $2.8 million. management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded $3.47 billion, or 81 percent, of total assets as of march31, 2015 compared to $3.50 billion, or 82 percent, of total assets as of december31, 2014.contractual obligationsthe following table presents the company's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient. the table excludes liabilities recorded where management cannot reasonably estimate the timing of any payments that may be required in connection with these

related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the company's risk profile, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to shareholders.   on july2, 2013, the federal reserve board, and on july9, 2013, the fdic, adopted a final rule that implements the basel iii changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the ‚Äúbasel iii rules.‚Äù the basel iii rules apply to both depository institutions and their holding companies. the basel iii rules, which became effective for both the company and the bank on january 1, 2015, include new risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements which refine the definition of what constitutes ‚Äúcapital‚Äù for purposes of calculating those ratios. the minimum capital level requirements applicable to the company and the bank under the basel iii rules are: (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from 4 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from current rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent for all institutions. common equity tier 1 capital will consist of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments. - 49 -the basel iii rules also establish a ‚Äúcapital conservation buffer‚Äù of 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. the conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, result in the following minimum ratios: (i)a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. the new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in january 2016 at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january 2019. an institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.the basel iii rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. the prompt corrective action rules were modified to include a common equity tier 1 capital component and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. for example, under the proposed prompt corrective action rules, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as ‚Äúwell capitalized:‚Äù (i)a new common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent; (ii)a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (increased from 6 percent); (iii)a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent (unchanged from current rules); and (iv)a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 percent (unchanged from current rules). the basel iii rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. the company's and the bank‚Äôs capital amounts and ratios as of march31, 2015 are presented in the table below.

informationthis periodic report on form 10-q contains certain ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù that represent management‚Äôs judgments concerning the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company‚Äôs actual operating results and financial position to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ‚Äúmay,‚Äù ‚Äúwill,‚Äù ‚Äúanticipate,‚Äù ‚Äúshould,‚Äù ‚Äúwould,‚Äù ‚Äúproject,‚Äù ‚Äúfuture,‚Äù ‚Äústrategy,‚Äù ‚Äúbelieve,‚Äù ‚Äúcontemplate,‚Äù ‚Äúexpect,‚Äù ‚Äúestimate,‚Äù ‚Äúcontinue,‚Äù ‚Äúintend,‚Äù ‚Äúseeks,‚Äù or other similar words and expressions of the future. risks and other factors that could influence the estimates include risks associated with any change in management, strategic direction, business plan, or operations, our management‚Äôs ability to successfully integrate the company‚Äôs business and execute its business plan across new and diverse markets in north carolina, south carolina and elsewhere, greater than expected costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired companies, local economic conditions affecting retail and commercial real estate, disruptions in the credit markets, particularly in light of continued economic uncertainty in the european union, continued political unrest and instability in the middle east; changes in interest rates, adverse developments in the real estate market affecting the value and marketability of collateral securing loans made by the bank, the failure of assumptions underlying loan loss and other reserves, competition and the risk of new and changing regulation, including, but not limited to recent proposals that would change capital standards and asset risk-weighting for financial institutions. additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company‚Äôs filings with the securities and exchange commission, including without limitation previous annual reports on form 10-k of the company and of predecessor companies. the forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date hereof, and the company does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as may otherwise be required by law.item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. like many financial institutions, the company‚Äôs most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. this goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. the goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. the company's overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board of directors and guidelines established and monitored by the bank‚Äôs asset/liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù).  to measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("nii") at risk, which measures the impact on nii over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("eve"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. nii at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on nii. eve is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the company's balance sheet, or equity. finally, gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measurement of the company's interest rate risk position. all of these models are subject to alco guidelines and are monitored regularly.in calculating nii at risk, the company begins with a base amount of nii that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. the current yield curve is then ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or moved immediately, ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. new twelve-month nii projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. the company also performs yield curve twist scenarios to evaluate potential nii at risk under different scenarios such as a flattening yield curve, a steepening curve, and others that management deems appropriate.eve at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. the present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. the company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values.key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. these assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future nii or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nii and eve. actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. projections of nii are assessed as part of the company's forecasting process.- 51 -nii and eve analysis.  the following table presents the estimated exposure to nii for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to eve due to immediate changes in interest rates. all information is presented as of march31, 2015.march31, 2015(dollars in thousands)estimated exposure to niiestimated exposure to eveimmediate change in interest rates:+ 4.0%11.10%5.76%+ 3.0%7.844.57+ 2.0%4.083.42+ 1.0%0.971.91no change‚Äî‚Äî- 1.0%(1.99)(3.98)while the measures presented in the table above are not a prediction of future nii or eve valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher nii in the short term. other important factors that impact the levels of nii are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.item 4. controls and proceduresthe company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), as of march31, 2015. based on that evaluation, the company‚Äôs chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company‚Äôs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.there were no changes in the company‚Äôs internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.- 52 -part ii.  other informationitem 1. legal proceedingsthe company and yadkin bank have been named defendants in legal actions arising from normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed. although the amount of any liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any liability arising from these matters will not have a material effect on yadkin's consolidated financial statements.item 1a. risk factorsin addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in part i, ‚Äúitem 1a. risk factors‚Äù in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december31, 2014, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described in our annual report on form 10-k are not the only risks facing the company. additional risks and uncertainties known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.item 2. unregistered sales of equity securities and use of

financial corporation (the "company" or "yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank (the "bank"). the company is a north carolina corporation headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of piedmont community bank holdings, inc. ("piedmont") as of and for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, which were included in annex e to the company's form s-4, amendment 2, which was filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on may 8, 2014. as discussed in further detail below, piedmont is the company's accounting predecessor.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. ("vantagesouth") and piedmont, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving corporation. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of the company for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of the company; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont. financial results of the company following the mergers reflect balances of the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. results of operations for the nine months ended september30, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending december 31, 2014. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. significant accounting policiesa description of the significant accounting policies followed by the company are set forth in note b of the notes to piedmont's consolidated financial statements, which were included in annex e to the company's form s-4, amendment 2, which was filed with the sec on may 8, 2014. upon completion of the mergers, the company added an accounting policy related to mortgage servicing rights ("msrs"). prior to the mergers, piedmont did not retain servicing for mortgage loans sold to investors, but the company acquired yadkin's mortgage servicing portfolio and now retains servicing on sold mortgage loans. below is a description of the company's recently adopted msr accounting policy.mortgage servicing rightsthe company retains servicing rights on mortgage loans sold to investors. msrs are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. msrs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. msrs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans, and impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. if impairment exists at the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage banking income.- 9 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)recently adopted and issued accounting standardsin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ("asu 2014-09"). asu 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. the amendments in this update are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations but may impact future financial statement disclosures.in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-04, receivables‚Äîtroubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. the amendments in this update clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. additionally, the amendments require interim and annual disclosure of both (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. the amendments in this update are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in january 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-01, investments‚Äîequity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. the amendments in this update permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). the amendments in this update are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. note b ‚Äì per share resultsbasic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common stock options and warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the company. basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below.three months ended september 30,nine months ended september 30,2014201320142013weighted average

statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)note c ‚Äì mergers and acquisitionsmergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont pursuant to the merger agreement. at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of the company for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of the company; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company has substantially completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.the piedmont phantom equity plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, was assumed by the company in the mergers. a total of 856,447 shares of yadkin‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont shareholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist was issued to a rabbi trust established by yadkin to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock. from an accounting perspective, 28,405 shares of yadkin's series t and t-acb preferred stock were assumed by the company in the mergers. the series t and t-acb preferred stock rank equally and have identical terms. they have no maturity date and pay cumulative dividends of 9.0 percent annually.as the legal acquirer, yadkin issued 17.3 million shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represented approximately 55 percent of the voting interests in the company at the time of the mergers. guidance in fasb asc 805-40-30-2 explains that the purchase price in a reverse merger is determined "based on the number of equity interests the legal [acquiree] would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal [acquirer] the same equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition." the first step in estimating the purchase price in the mergers is to determine the ownership of the combined institution following the mergers. the table below summarizes, for each shareholder group immediately prior to the mergers, the ownership of yadkin common stock immediately following the mergers as well as the market capitalization of the combined institution using yadkin‚Äôs stock price at the time of the mergers. yadkin financial corporation ownership and market value tableshareholder groups immediately prior to

per share amounts)explanation of fair value adjustments(a) adjustment reflects opening fair value of securities portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio.(b) adjustment reflects the elimination of yadkin's historical allowance for loan losses of $16.4 million and the recording of a fair value discount of $47.2 million on the loan portfolio. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(c) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on certain acquired branch offices as well as certain software and computer equipment. (d) adjustment reflects the write down of certain foreclosed assets based on current estimates of property values given current market conditions and additional discounts based on the company's planned disposition strategy. (e) adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments.(f) goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets.(g) adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible. (h) adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include mortgage servicing assets, certain unusable prepaid expenses, and the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans. (i) adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. (j) adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for subordinated debt issued to fund trust preferred securities and long-term federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, which were calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for similar instruments. for fhlb advances, the fair value adjustment is consistent with the prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.(k) adjustments reflect accruals and fair value adjustments for other liabilities, which include the write-off of unearned income, deferred gains, and accrued liabilities that will not be paid. (l) no fair value adjustments were made to yadkin's outstanding preferred stock. the current preferred dividend rate of 9.0 percent approximates the current market yield for issuances of similar perpetual preferred stock. the preferred stock is currently redeemable at the liquidation value, and the company expects the remaining life of this preferred stock to be relatively short. (m) the fair value of the common stock warrants was estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model assuming all 91,178 warrants will remain outstanding through expiration on july24, 2019. assumptions and inputs used in the option pricing model included stock price volatility of 48.6 percent, no dividends, a risk free interest rate of 1.74 percent, and an exercise price of $21.90 per common warrant.the table below presents supplemental pro forma information as if the mergers with vantagesouth and piedmont as well as the ecb merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was january 1, 2013. pro forma results include adjustments for amortization and accretion of preliminary estimated fair value adjustments and do not include any projected cost savings or other anticipated benefits of the mergers. therefore, the pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction(s) been effected on the assumed date. pro forma financial information has not been provided for the three months ended september 30, 2014 since the various entities involved in the mergers were combined for substantially the entire period.three months ended september 30, 2013nine months ended september 30,supplemental pro forma information20142013net interest income$38,632$118,700$114,560net income$7,203$19,778$14,226net income available to common shareholders$6,782$17,981$12,505basic income per common share$0.24$0.58$0.44diluted income per common share$0.24$0.57$0.44weighted average basic common shares outstanding28,587,36431,193,72828,557,784weighted average diluted common shares outstanding28,690,78231,296,06528,610,786- 13 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)ecb bancorp, inc. mergeron april 1, 2013, the company completed the merger of ecb bancorp, inc. ("ecb") with and into vantagesouth (the "ecb merger"). the ecb merger was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 25, 2012 (the "ecb merger agreement"). immediately following the ecb merger, the east carolina bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ecb, was merged with and into the bank. upon the closing of the ecb merger, each outstanding share of ecb common stock was converted into the right to receive 3.55 shares of common stock of vantagesouth. the aggregate merger consideration consisted of 10.3 million shares of vantagesouth's common stock. based upon the market price of vantagesouth's common stock immediately prior to the ecb merger, the transaction value was $40,629.pursuant to the merger agreement, the company agreed to exchange each share of ecb‚Äôs fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series a, into one share of vantagesouth's fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series b ("series b preferred stock"). at the closing of the ecb merger, the company also issued a warrant to purchase 514,693.2 shares of vantagesouth's common stock to the u.s. department of the treasury (‚Äútreasury‚Äù) in exchange for the warrant issued by ecb to treasury on january 16, 2009 to purchase 144,984 shares of ecb‚Äôs common stock. the warrant issuance reflected the exchange ratio associated with the ecb merger.because ecb merged into vantagesouth, which was a controlled subsidiary of piedmont, the shares of vantagesouth common stock issued to legacy ecb shareholders as merger consideration as well as the series b preferred stock and related common stock warrants assumed by vantagesouth in the ecb merger were classified on piedmont's consolidated balance sheets as part of non-controlling interests. the series b preferred stock was subsequently redeemed by the company on february 19, 2014, and the related common stock warrants were subsequently repurchased by the company on june 11, 2014.the following table presents the ecb assets acquired, liabilities assumed and other equity interests as of april 1, 2013 as well as the related purchase price allocation and calculation of the gain on acquisition.as reported by ecb at april 1, 2013initial fair value adjustmentsmeasurement period adjustmentsas reported by the company at april 1, 2013assets:cash and cash equivalents$24,008$‚Äî$‚Äî$24,008investment securities available for sale289,058301(a)‚Äî289,359loans held for sale3,8579,790(b)(191)(m)13,456loans, net483,474(30,420)(c)‚Äî453,054federal home loan bank stock, at cost3,150‚Äî‚Äî3,150premises and equipment25,633(1,177)(d)135(m)24,591bank-owned life insurance12,249‚Äî‚Äî12,249foreclosed assets7,090(717)(e)(305)(m)6,068deferred tax asset, net6,9869,082(f)540(m)16,608other intangible assets‚Äî4,307(g)‚Äî4,307accrued interest receivable and other assets10,423(665)(h)(922)(m)8,836total assets865,928(9,499)(743)855,686liabilities:deposits$731,926$4,188(i)$‚Äî$736,114short-term borrowings34,284‚Äî‚Äî34,284long-term debt16,000460(j)‚Äî16,460accrued interest payable and other liabilities2,867148(k)116(m)3,131total liabilities785,0774,796116789,989net assets acquired80,851(14,295)(859)65,697other equity interests:preferred stock17,660(107)(l)‚Äî17,553common stock warrant878(745)(l)‚Äî133total other equity interests18,538(852)‚Äî17,686gain on acquisition7,382purchase price$40,629- 14 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)explanation of fair value adjustments(a) adjustment reflects opening fair value of securities portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio.(b) adjustment reflect the reclassification of the fair value of certain loans identified by management as being held for sale at acquisition.(c) adjustment reflects the elimination of ecb's historical allowance for loan losses and the recording of a fair value discount on the loan portfolio. the fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio.(d) adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on certain acquired branch offices as well as certain software and computer equipment.

post-acquisition within the measurement period. measurement period adjustments included tax-effected adjustments to reduce the  fair value of a non-marketable investment, to dispose of other assets with no value at the merger, to reduce the fair value of certain distressed loans held for sale, to reduce the fair value of certain other real estate owned, to recognize a liability for outstanding

experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does - 16 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)not believe that it will be required to sell the

information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. the company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings:‚Ä¢pass.  these loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted.‚Ä¢special mention. loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date.‚Ä¢substandard.  loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.‚Ä¢doubtful.  loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.- 20 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)the following tables summarize the risk

amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $243 in the three months ended september 30, 2014. the table below summarizes msr activity for the periods presented. the company did not retain mortgage servicing on loans sold prior to the mergers, thus the table below only includes current quarter activity.three months ended september 30,20142013balance at beginning of period$‚Äî$‚Äîacquired yadkin

the pool level, the msr is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table.the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msrs. generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the msr. measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.the characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table.september 30, 2014composition of

sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. also, in this table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs is calculated without changing any other assumptions, while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changing another, which may magnify or contract the effect of the change.sba-guaranteed loan servicing the company retains the servicing rights on sba-guaranteed loans sold to investors. the standard sale structure under the sba secondary participation guaranty agreement provides for the company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. the unpaid principal balance of sba-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was $121,968 as of september 30, 2014. sba-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. sba servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. sba servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled $295 and $131 for the three months ended september 30, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and totaled $739 and $358 for the nine months ended september 30, 2014, and 2013, respectively.the table below summarizes

when certain triggering events occur. if the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against sba income. there was no valuation allowance recorded on the sba-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of september30, 2014, or december31, 2013.note g ‚Äì commitments and contingenciesthe company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the company has in particular classes of financial instruments. the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. the company evaluates each customer‚Äôs creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit.the following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the company‚Äôs exposure to off-balance sheet commitments.- 26 -yadkin financial

balance sheets. note h ‚Äì derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. these instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives. interest rate swapsin may 2013, the company entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swaps on $75,000 of forecasted short-term fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective date, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-day libor component of future variable rate interest on three-month fhlb advances, or other short-term borrowings, with fixed interest rates ranging from 1.65 to 1.72 percent. in august 2014, the company entered into another series of forward starting interest rate swaps on $100,000 of forecasted short-term fhlb advances to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in three-month libor. beginning on the respective effective date, these interest rate swaps will exchange the three-month libor component of future variable rate interest on three-month fhlb advances, or other short-term borrowings, with fixed interest rates ranging from 2.44 to 2.88 percent. each three-month fhlb advance, or other short-term borrowing, will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the term of each respective swap. in august 2014, the company entered into two additional forward starting interest rate swaps on a total of $50,000 of forecasted brokered money market deposits to reduce its exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in one-month libor. beginning on the respective effective date, these interest rate swaps will exchange one-month libor, plus the applicable spread, with fixed interest rates. both of these brokered money market accounts are expected to have at least $25,000 each on deposit with the company from the effective date through the maturity of the interest rate swaps. these interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income ("oci"). the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's economic value of equity at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the

crescent financial capital trust i, an unconsolidated trust formed to issue trust preferred securities ("trups"). in august 2014, the company also purchased separate interest rate cap contracts on $25,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to yadkin valley statutory trust i and on $10,000 in junior subordinated debt previously issued to american community capital trust. the underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month libor. in the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate. these interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in oci. the purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the company's economic value of equity at risk in a rising interest rate environment. the following table summarizes key terms of

sell mortgages to investors under best-efforts contracts. the forward sale commitments are entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. these derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. the fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.the following table

i ‚Äì fair value measurementsthe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. for example, investment securities available for sale and derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, impaired loans and foreclosed assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.investment securities. investment securities available for sale ("afs") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security‚Äôs credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include marketable securities traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, or sba-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, both issued by gses, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. level 3 securities include certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented. three months ended september 30,nine months ended september

basis. generally, the company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. the unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring level 2.derivatives. derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. currently outstanding derivatives are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.mortgage loan commitments. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 3. the following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented. - 29 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands,

sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as level 2. the difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations.loans. loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. however, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. the fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. for impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. when the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring level 2. when an appraised value is not available, or the company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring level 3.foreclosed assets. foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to foreclosed assets. subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management‚Äôs estimation of the value of the collateral. given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the company classifies foreclosed assets as nonrecurring level 3.the following tables summarize information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.fair value measurements as of september 30,

assetsdiscounted appraisalscollateral discounts15-50%$11,078the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company‚Äôs interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company‚Äôs mortgage banking department.due to the nature of the company‚Äôs business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. the fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. in addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company taken as a whole.- 31 -yadkin financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)cash and cash equivalents. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are equal to fair value.investment securities available for sale. see the discussion related to fair value estimates for securities available for sale in the fair value hierarchy section above. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the nine months ended september30, 2014. investment securities held to maturity. the fair value of the one corporate bond classified as held to maturity as of december 31, 2013 was estimated based on recent issuance yields on subordinated debt from companies with a similar credit and liquidity profile. due to the non-marketable nature of this bond, it was classified as level 3. this bond was called at par by the issuer in the first quarter of 2014. the fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity as of september30, 2014 are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security‚Äôs credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. these securities are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs.loans held for sale. the fair value of loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market for mortgage and sba loans with similar characteristics. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the nine months ended september30, 2014.loans. expected cash flows are forecasted over the remaining life of each loan and are discounted to present value at current market interest rates for similar loans considering loan collateral type and credit quality. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the nine

changes in valuation techniques for the nine months ended september30, 2014.bank-owned life insurance. bank-owned life insurance investments are recorded at their cash surrender value, or the amount that can be realized upon surrender. therefore, carrying value approximates fair value.purchased accounts receivable. purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying value approximates fair value.deposits. the fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and now accounts represents the amount payable on demand. the fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the nine months ended september30, 2014.short-term borrowings and long-term debt. the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at which borrowings of similar maturity could be obtained. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the nine months ended september30, 2014. accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable. the carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. there have been no

analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyadkin financial corporation (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù or ‚Äúyadkin‚Äù) is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of north carolina and headquartered in raleigh, north carolina. the company conducts its business operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, yadkin bank, a full-service state-chartered community bank providing services in 73 branches across north carolina and upstate south carolina.yadkin bank‚Äôs primary business is providing banking, mortgage, investment and insurance services to residents and businesses across the carolinas.management‚Äôs discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company. this discussion and analysis includes descriptions of significant transactions, trends and other factors affecting the company‚Äôs operating results for the three and nine months ended september30, 2014 and 2013 as well as the financial condition of the company as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.mergers with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc.on july 4, 2014, the company completed its mergers (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc. (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù) and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, as amended (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving corporation. piedmont owned a controlling interest in vantagesouth at the time of the mergers. pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of vantagesouth common stock received 0.3125 shares of voting common stock of the company for each share of vantagesouth common stock. holders of piedmont common stock received (i) 6.28597 shares of voting common stock of the company; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of voting common stock of the company at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, the wholly owned banking subsidiary of vantagesouth, merged with and into yadkin bank.the mergers were accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting primarily due to the relative voting interests in the company upon completion of the mergers. as a result, piedmont and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer, and yadkin represents the accounting acquiree. therefore, the historical financial results of the company prior to the mergers reflect the historical balances of piedmont, and the financial results of the company after the mergers reflect the combined organization. in addition, the assets and liabilities of yadkin as of the date of the mergers have been recorded at estimated fair value and added to those of piedmont. the company has substantially completed its valuations of yadkin's assets and liabilities but may refine those valuations for up to a year from the date of the mergers. the mergers had a significant impact on all aspects of the company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the mergers may not be comparable to financial results prior to the mergers.executive summarythe following is a summary of the company‚Äôs financial highlights and significant events for the third quarter of 2014:‚Ä¢net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain non-operating items, improved to $11.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in q3 2014. net income available

measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures.  the company's management uses these non-gaap financial measures, including: (i) net operating earnings available to common shareholders; (ii) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, (iii) operating non-interest income, (iv) operating non-interest expense, (v) operating efficiency ratio, (vi) adjusted allowance for loan losses to loans; and (vii) tangible common equity, in its analysis of the company's performance. the adjusted allowance for loan losses non-gaap reconciliation is presented within the allowance for loan losses section below. the tangible common equity non-gaap reconciliations, which include tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, are presented within the capital section below.management believes that non-gaap financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company without regard to transactional activities.non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under gaap, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under gaap and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company.non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under gaap.  analysis of results of operations 3q 2014 compared to 3q 2013net income was $949 thousand in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2013. net income available to common shareholders was $319 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $479 thousand, or $0.05 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2013. net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes securities gains and losses, branch sale gains, acquisition gains, merger and conversion costs, and restructuring charges, improved to $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2013 as the company benefited from significant operating leverage provided by the mergers. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2013.year-to-datenet income was $6.4 million in the first nine months of 2014, which was an increase from $2.8 million in the first nine months of 2013. net income available to common shareholders was $3.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share, in the first nine months of 2014, an increase from $418 thousand, or $0.05 per diluted common share, in the first nine months of 2013. net operating earnings available to common shareholders improved to $16.2 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to $3.2 million in the first nine months of 2013. similarly, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings increased to $34.9 million in the first nine months of 2014 from $12.7 million in the first nine months of 2013.net interest income 3q 2014 compared to 3q 2013net interest income improved to $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $20.0 million in the third quarter of 2013. the increase in net interest income was the result of a significant increase in earning assets from the mergers, organic business activity, and an improved net interest margin. average earning assets increased from $1.80 billion in the third quarter of 2013 to $3.53 billion in the third quarter of 2014. over this period, average loan balances increased by $1.43 billion, of which $1.39 billion was from acquired yadkin loans, and average investment securities increased by $312.3 million, of which $257.7 million was from to acquired yadkin investments. in addition, average deposits increased by $1.52 billion, of which $1.51 billion was from acquired yadkin deposits.the company's net interest margin expanded from 4.40 percent in the third quarter of 2013 to 4.68 percent in the third quarter of 2014. the improved net interest margin was due to lower funding costs, a higher taxable-equivalent yield on the investment securities portfolio, and an improved mix of earning assets. the yield on earning assets increased from 4.91 percent in the third quarter of 2013 to 5.12 percent in the third quarter of 2014. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined from 0.58 percent in the third quarter of 2013 to 0.54 percent in the third quarter of 2014, which primarily reflected lower deposit costs from the addition of the yadkin deposit base.- 37 -net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2014, which consisted of $1.3 million of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired (‚Äúpci‚Äù) loans and $5.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the third quarter of 2013 totaled $3.0 million, which included $526 thousand of net accretion on pci loans and $2.5 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included $1.9 million of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $895 thousand in the third quarter of 2013.the following table summarizes the major components of net interest income and the related yields and costs for the quarterly periods presented.three months ended

nine months of 2014 compared to $50.6 million in the first nine months of 2013. the increase in net interest income was the result of a significant increase in earning assets from the mergers and organic business activity, partially offset by a lower net interest margin. average earning assets increased from $1.80 billion in the first nine months of 2013 to $3.53 billion in the first nine months of 2014. over this period, average loan balances increased by $704.5 million, and average investment securities balances increased by $200.2 million. in addition, average deposits increased by $588.8 million.the company's net interest margin declined from 4.49 percent in the first nine months of 2013 to 4.42 percent in the first nine months of 2014. the lower net interest margin was due to a reduction in yields on interest-earning assets and higher costs on interest-bearing liabilities. the yield on earning assets declined from 5.01 percent in the first nine months of 2013 to 4.95 percent in the first nine months of 2014, which primarily reflected lower yields on loans. the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.59 percent in the first nine months of 2013 to 0.61 percent in the first nine months of 2014, which was primarily due to acquired yadkin debt obligations and subordinated notes issued in the third quarter of 2013 at a fixed rate of 7.625 percent. net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $13.1 million in the first nine months of 2014, which consisted of $3.3 million of net accretion on pci loans and $9.9 million of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. net accretion income on acquired loans in the first nine months of 2013 totaled $7.2 million, which included $2.2 million of net accretion on pci loans and $4.9 million

year third quarter was primarily due to the change in provision expense on pci loans. the $220 thousand provision recovery on certain pci loan pools in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $357 thousand of provision expense resulting from impairment identified in the prior year on certain pci loan pools. provision expense on non-pci loans increased primarily due to strong organic loan growth during the third quarter of 2014. the alll was $7.6 million, or 0.27 percent of total loans as of september30, 2014, compared to $7.5 million, or 0.54 percent of total loans as of june30, 2014, and $7.0 million, or 0.52 percent of total loans as of september30, 2013. the decline in alll to total loans was primarily due to merger accounting. upon completion of the mergers, yadkin's alll was eliminated, and the acquired loan portfolio was adjusted to estimated fair value. adjusted alll, which includes the alll and net acquisition accounting fair value adjustments for acquired loans, represented 2.50 percent of total loans as of september30, 2014 compared to 2.42 percent as of june30, 2014 and 3.04 percent as of september30, 2013. annualized net charge-offs were 0.09 percent of average loans in the third quarter of 2014 compared to 0.20 percent of average loans in the third quarter of 2013.- 41 -nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.90 percent as of september30, 2014, compared to 1.53 percent as of june30, 2014, and 1.39 percent as of september30, 2013. total nonperforming assets (which include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and foreclosed assets) as a percentage of total assets was 0.88 percent as of september30, 2014, compared to 1.44 percent as of june30, 2014, and 1.48 percent as of september30, 2013. due to the significance of the company's acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, traditional credit ratios should not be used when comparing prior periods to the current period or when comparing the company to other financial institutions. specifically, the current period (i) alll to total loans, (ii) alll to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions.loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. if the company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. if there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the company will first reverse any previously established alll and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans. events that would result in probable increases in expected cash flows include (i) increases in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming non-collateral dependent during the period for which there was an estimated collateral shortfall in prior estimations, (iii) actual cash flow collections in excess of prior estimates, and (iv) improvement in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors.results of the company‚Äôs cash flow re-estimation for pci loans in the third quarter 2014 are summarized as follows.(dollars in thousands)provisionyield adjustmentprevious yieldnew yieldloan

as servicing fees on previously sold sba loans, increased by $547 thousand due to a higher volume of loan originations and sales as the company continues to expand its government lending presence into new markets. mortgage banking income increased by $1.2 million due to higher production volumes with the addition of yadkin's mortgage bankers as well as servicing income generated by yadkin's

increase in expenses was primarily due to $17.3 million in merger and conversion costs, which included professional fees, severance, and other expenses required to close the mergers as well as costs to convert data processing, technology, signage, and branch network to the company's integrated platform. operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from $18.5 million in the third quarter of 2013 to $30.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other non-interest expense categories all increased as a result of the mergers, which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the company's expense base. the company's operating efficiency ratio, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, improved from 75.3 percent in the third quarter of 2013 to 61.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to the significant scale and operating leverage provided by the mergers.year-to-datenon-interest expense totaled $85.4 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to $63.5 million in the

percent in the third quarter of 2014 due to higher tax-fee income on municipal bonds and bank-owned life insurance compared to prior periods. the effective tax rate, which still exceeded the company's statutory tax rate in the quarter, was negatively impacted by non-deductible merger costs. income tax expense in the third quarter of 2013 included a $1.2 million charge as a result of decreases to north carolina corporate income tax rates enacted in that period.year-to-dateincome tax expense was $4.8 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to an income tax benefit of $206 thousand in

thousand, respectively, as of december31, 2013. the securities portfolio increased significantly in the year-to-date period due to the mergers, but the company also expanded and repositioned the portfolio after the mergers to provide additional on-balance sheet liquidity and income. the company intends to use principal cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund loan growth over the next several quarters.marketable investment securities accounted for as available for sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to accumulated other comprehensive income. marketable investment securities accounted for as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. the investment securities portfolio as of september30, 2014, consisted of u.s. government-sponsored enterprise ("gse") obligations, securities guaranteed by the u.s. small business administration ("sba"), mortgage-backed securities issued by gses, investment grade corporate bonds, investment grade non-agency cmbs, investment grade non-taxable municipal bonds, and equity securities of certain financial institutions. as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013, the available-for-sale securities portfolio had $2.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of unrealized gains and $9.5 million and $13.0 million, respectively, of unrealized losses. the securities in an unrealized loss position as of september30, 2014 continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. further, because the company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of

are fair to the client and profitable to the company. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. in this context, the company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality.loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled $2.83 billion as of september30, 2014, which was an increase of $1.43 billion since december31, 2013, the combined result of the yadkin merger and strong organic growth. the company expects opportunities for new loan originations to continue to be competitive and believes it is well-positioned to originate loans to maintain its net lending levels while meeting its underwriting criteria. the composition of the company‚Äôs loan portfolio as of september30, 2014, was as follows: 47.5 percent in commercial real estate loans, 15.5 percent in commercial and industrial loans, 11.8 percent in commercial construction and land development loans, 13.0 percent in residential real estate loans, 1.1 percent in consumer construction and land development loans, 9.8 percent in home equity loans and lines of credit, and 1.4 percent in consumer loans. the composition of the loan portfolio as of december31, 2013, was as follows: 48.3 percent in commercial real estate loans, 16.6 percent in commercial and industrial loans, 12.5 percent in commercial construction and land development loans, 13.7 percent in residential real estate loans, 1.6 percent in consumer construction and land development loans, 6.8 percent in home equity loans and lines of credit, and 0.6 percent in consumer loans. for each acquired loan portfolio, the company made fair value adjustments by projecting expected future principal and interest cash flows over the remaining life of each loan and then discounting those cash flows based on then-current market rates for similar loans. because acquired loans are marked to fair value and the legacy allowance for loan losses is eliminated at acquisition, the company believes an analysis of the loan portfolio carrying value and unpaid borrower principal balances ("upb") is important in evaluating the portfolio.the following table summarizes the upb and

maturities are presented based on the final contractual maturity of each loan and do not reflect contractual principal payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans. loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as pci loans. where possible, pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. for pci loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the pci loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for pci loans and not to contractual interest payments. the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. the recorded investment in pci loans as of september30, 2014, totaled $223.0 million, of which $221.9 million were grouped into pools and $1.1 million were accounted for on an individual loan basis. the recorded investment in pci loans as of december31, 2013, totaled $180.0 million, of which $178.7 million were grouped into pools and $1.3 million were accounted for on an individual loan basis.nonperforming assetsloans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.  pci loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. these loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the company's pci loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. however, pci loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. the past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.- 48 -while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. in the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense.loans, excluding pooled pci loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (‚Äútdr‚Äù) by the company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. the company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. the company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. the company‚Äôs policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a tdr follows relevant supervisory guidance. that is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. if a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. the company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.pci loans that were classified as tdrs prior to acquisition are not classified as tdrs by the company after the acquisition date. subsequent modification of a pci loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a tdr is not reported, or accounted for, as a tdr since pooled pci loans are excluded from the scope of tdr accounting. a pci loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a tdr if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a tdr after the acquisition date.nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.90 percent as of september30, 2014, compared to 1.52 percent as of december31, 2013, and 1.39 percent as of september30, 2013. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of september30, 2014, totaled 0.88 percent, compared to 1.49 percent as of december31, 2013, and 1.48 percent as of september30, 2013. acquired pci loans that are included in loan pools, including acquired yadkin pci loans, are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. the following

alll methodology primarily relates to non-pci loans. the evaluation of pci loans for impairment follows a different methodology which is described above. the alll is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. balances are charged against the alll when the collectability of principal is unlikely. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the alll. the alll is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. management evaluates the adequacy of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. for non-pci loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of the alll includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. the determination of loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment involves considerations of historic loan loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors such as current delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition, prevailing economic conditions, the loan review function, and other relevant factors. the annualized trailing three-year historical loss rates are used in combination with the qualitative factors to determine appropriate loss rates for each identified risk category.the company utilizes an internal grading system to assign the degree of inherent risk on each loan in the portfolio. the risk grade is initially assigned by the lending officer and reviewed by the credit administration function. the internal risk grading system is reviewed and tested periodically by the loan review function. the company's alll model uses the internal loan grading system to segment each category of loans by risk grade. calculated loss rates are weighted more heavily for higher risk loans.  a loan, excluding pci loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. pci loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment.- 50 -the following table presents the allocation of the alll for the periods presented.september 30, 2014december31, 2013(dollars in

shifted to a higher percentage of non-interest demand deposits, with reductions in the percentage of deposits held in interest-bearing demand and time deposit accounts. the company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. the average cost of deposits was 0.30 percent in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 0.39 percent in the third quarter of 2013, due to changes in deposit mix and lower deposit interest rates. borrowings and long-term debtthe company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. short-term borrowings totaled $216.5 million and $126.5 million as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively, and consisted of fhlb advances maturing within twelve months. the balance of fhlb advances increased with the mergers, but these balances have also increased to partially fund loan growth and to provide short-term funding that management has used to hedge in order to manage the company's interest rate risk position.the company had outstanding long-term fhlb advances of $134.8 million and $19.2 million as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013, long-term debt included $7.0 million in a subordinated term loan due in 2018 as well as $38.1 million in fixed rate subordinated notes due in 2023. as of september30, 2014, long-term debt also included a total of $24.3 million in junior subordinated debentures issued to various unconsolidated trusts which were formed to issue trust preferred securities. this amount grew from a balance of $5.6 million as of december31, 2013 due to two acquired yadkin trusts. capital lease obligations, which are included in long-term debt, totaled $6.0 million and  $3.1 million as of september30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.- 52 -shareholders‚Äô equitytotal shareholders‚Äô equity was $542.3 million as of september30, 2014, which was an increase of $304.3 million from december31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to net assets acquired in the mergers of $308.2 million. in addition, shareholders' equity was benefited by net income of $6.4 million and other comprehensive income of $1.3 million. dividends on preferred stock of $630 thousand and a capital distribution to legacy piedmont shareholders of $9.8 million, previously agreed upon in the mergers, reduced shareholders' equity.liquidityliquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. the company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the board of directors. investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, and available borrowings from the fhlb, the federal reserve bank, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the bank. the primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases. the primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are preferred stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and trups, and operating expenses. the primary source of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the bank. in addition, on july 2, 2014, the holding company entered into a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at libor plus 4.0 percent. the loan agreement will expire on july 1, 2015. however, the company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. the obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the bank.as of september30, 2014, the company's liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale) totaled $786.1 million, which represented 19 percent of total assets and 25 percent of total deposits. supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the company has available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled $244.3 million as of september30, 2014. as of september30, 2014, outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled $690.3 million and outstanding capital commitments to a private investment fund were $3.2 million. management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded $3.41 billion, or 82 percent, of total assets as of september30, 2014 compared with $1.77 billion, or 83 percent, of total assets as of december31, 2013.contractual obligationsthe following

capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. the company's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the company's risk profile, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to shareholders.   banking regulators have defined capital into the following components:  (1) tier 1 capital, which includes common stockholders' equity and qualifying preferred equity, and (2) tier 2 capital, which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses, certain qualifying long-term debt and preferred stock which does not qualify as tier 1 capital. minimum capital levels are regulated by risk-based capital adequacy guidelines which require a financial institution to maintain capital as a percent of its assets and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors (risk-adjusted assets). a financial institution is required to maintain, at a minimum, tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets of 4.0 percent and combined tier 1 and tier 2 capital as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets of 8.0 percent. in addition to the risk-based guidelines, federal regulations require the bank to maintain a minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of tangible assets) of 4.0 percent. the company's and the bank‚Äôs capital amounts and ratios as of september30, 2014 are presented in the table below. actualminimum for capital adequacy

obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as may otherwise be required by law.item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. like many financial institutions, the company‚Äôs most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. this goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. the goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. the company's overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board of directors and guidelines established and monitored by the bank‚Äôs asset/liability committee (‚Äúalco‚Äù).  to measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("nii") at risk, which measures the impact on nii over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("eve"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. nii at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on nii. eve is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the company's balance sheet, or equity. finally, gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measurement of the company's interest rate risk position. all of these models are subject to alco guidelines and are monitored regularly.in calculating nii at risk, the company begins with a base amount of nii that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. the current yield curve is then ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or moved immediately, ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. new twelve-month nii projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. the company also performs yield curve twist scenarios to evaluate potential nii at risk under different scenarios such as a flattening yield curve, a steepening curve, and others that management deems necessary.eve at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. the present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. the company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of ¬±1.0 percent, ¬±2.0 percent, ¬±3.0 percent and ¬±4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values.key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. these assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future nii or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nii and eve. actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. projections of nii are assessed as part of the company's forecasting process.- 55 -nii and eve analysis.  the following table presents the estimated exposure to nii for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to eve due to immediate changes in interest rates. all information is presented as of september 30, 2014september 30, 2014(dollars in thousands)estimated exposure to niiestimated exposure to eveimmediate change in interest rates:+ 4.0%9.01%1.81%+

all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher nii in the short term. other important factors that impact the levels of nii are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.item 4. controls and proceduresthe company‚Äôs management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), as of september30, 2014. based on

that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec‚Äôs rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company‚Äôs management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.there were no changes in the company‚Äôs internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal

statements1.  significant accounting policiesbasis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation  (the "company") and its subsidiary, yadkin bank (the "bank").  the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial statements and with instructions to form 10-q and regulation s-x.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for complete financial statements.  because the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included with the company's 2013 annual report on form 10-k (the "2013 form 10-k") filed with the securities and exchange commission (‚Äúsec‚Äù) on february 28, 2014.  operating results, for the three and six months ended june30, 2014, do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the year or other interim periods.in the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments, all of which are normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of june30, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended june30, 2014 and 2013.  the accounting policies followed are set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the company's 2013 form 10-k.recently adopted accounting standardsin january 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-04, "receivables‚Äîtroubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure". ("asu 2014-04"). the amendments in this update clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. additionally, the amendments require interim and annual disclosure of both (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. the amendments in this update are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2014. adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the company‚Äôs financial position or results of operations. in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, ‚Äúrevenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)‚Äù (‚Äúasu 2014-09‚Äù).   asu 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. asu 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within that period, beginning after december 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. the company does not expect asu 2014-09 to have a material effect on the company‚Äôs current financial position or results of operations, however, it may impact the reporting of future financial statement disclosures.in 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-12, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period" ("asu 2014-12").  the asu requires performance targets that affect vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as performance conditions. as a result, such performance targets should not be included in the grant-date fair value calculation of the award, rather compensation cost should be recorded when it is probable the performance target will be reached and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. if the requisite service period is not over, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. this update is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 for all entities.   earlier adoption is permitted. entities may apply the amendments in this update either prospectively to awards granted after the effective date, or retrospectively to awards with yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 7table of contentsoutstanding performance targets as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented.  management does not believe the amendments will have a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.2. mergers and acquisitionson july 4, 2014, the company completed the merger of vantagesouth bancshares, inc., (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù), and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù), with and into the company (the "mergers").  the mergers were completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, by and among the company, vantagesouth and piedmont (as amended, the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù).  at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving corporation.  immediately following the mergers,  vantagesouth bank, a north carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of vantagesouth, was merged with and into the bank, with the bank continuing as the surviving bank.  pursuant to the merger agreement, each outstanding share of vantagesouth common stock (other than shares held by piedmont which were cancelled) was converted into the right to receive 0.3125 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock.  each outstanding share of piedmont common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share, (i) 6.28597 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan.  the piedmont phantom plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, has been assumed by the company.   a total of 856,447 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont stockholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist has been issued to a rabbi trust established by the company to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock.  the company issued approximately 17,271,145 shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represents 55.7% of the voting interests in the company. the mergers will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic 805-10, business combinations.  management is undertaking a comprehensive review and determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the company to ensure that they conform to the measurement and reporting guidance as set forth for the accounting for business combinations.  determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, especially in the loan portfolio and foreclosed real estate, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values.  accordingly, the initial accounting for the mergers is not complete.  management is also undertaking a comprehensive review of the classification of certain assets and liabilities to ensure that they conform to the company‚Äôs current policies and reporting practices.  as a result of these efforts, the value and classification of certain assets and liabilities may vary in subsequent reporting periods.future filings will include the financial statements of piedmont (consolidated with vantagesouth) for all periods presented, with recognition of the company‚Äôs activity from the date the mergers were completed.  the company‚Äôs financial statements for all periods through the date of the mergers will not be included in future filings.  see note 16 entitled ‚Äúsubsequent events‚Äù for additional information on the mergers.the table below presents proforma information as if the company's merger with vantage had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was january 1, 2014.  the proforma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 8table of contentsthree months endedsix months endedjune 30, 2014june 30,

2014 11table of contentssecurities.  the key factors considered in evaluating the collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, and municipal securities were cash flows of the investment and the assessment of other relative economic factors, such as credit risk.  securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at december31, 2013 include one u.s. government agency, one collateralized mortgage obligation, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and nine state and municipal securities.   the unrealized losses relate to securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to a shift in demand from non-governmental securities and municipals to u.s. treasury bonds and governmental agencies due to market concerns. the unrealized losses are not likely to reverse unless market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. none of the unrealized losses relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer's ability to honor redemption obligations.  it is not more likely than not that the company will have to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. for the three and six months ended june30, 2014, there were no securities available-for-sale deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (‚Äúotti‚Äù).   if management determines

2014 and $5,283,254 at december31, 2013.  cost method investments at june30, 2014 include $3,778,000 in federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock and $772,796 of investments in various trust and financial companies, which are included in other assets.  all cost method investments were evaluated for impairment at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013.  the following factors have been considered in determining the carrying amount of fhlb stock: 1) the recoverability of the par value, 2) the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all operational needs in the foreseeable future and would not need to dispose of the stock below recorded amounts, 3) redemptions and purchases of the stock are at the discretion of the fhlb, 4) the company believes the fhlb has the ability to absorb economic losses given the expectation that the various fhlbs' have a high degree of government support, and 5) the unrealized losses related to securities owned by the fhlb are manageable given the capital levels of the organization.   during the six months ended june 30, 2013 the company's investment in a financial services company was considered to be other than temporarily impaired and approximately $39,185 was charged-off.    there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.    6.  commitments and contingenciesin the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  at june30, 2014, the company had commitments outstanding of $331.1 million  for additional loan amounts.  commitments of the bank's mortgage lending department are excluded from this amount and discussed in the paragraph below.  additional commitments totaling $6.5 million were outstanding under standby letters of credit.  management does not expect any significant losses to result from these commitments. at june30, 2014, the bank had $24.3 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $39.6 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  see note 9 for additional disclosures on these derivative financial instruments.7.    earnings per common sharebasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting periods.  diluted net income available to common shareholders per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  the numerators of the basic net income per common share computations are the same as the numerators of the diluted net income per common share computations for all the periods presented.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended june30, 2014 excludes 161,504 shares of unvested restricted stock.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended june 30, 2013 excludes 178,281 shares of unvested restricted stock.  a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computations to the denominator of the diluted net income

2014, there were 47,175 stock options that were not considered dilutive because the exercise prices exceeded the average market price per share.  the non-dilutive options had exercise prices ranging from $20.37 to $57.21 per share for the periods ended june 30, 2014. during the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, 102,312 and 104,475 shares of restricted stock were not considered dilutive because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method or because performance and service criteria had not been met, respectively.  during the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, there were 53,616 warrants and stock options that were not considered dilutive.  during the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, there were 159,665  and 205,359 shares of restricted stock that were not

modernization act, pursuant to section 53c-4-7 of which, the bank, as a north carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends if such distributions will not reduce its capital below its applicable ‚Äúrequired capital.‚Äù the bank's ‚Äúrequired capital‚Äù is that amount of capital required for the bank to be deemed ‚Äúadequately capitalized‚Äù under applicable federal regulatory capital ratios.  currently, the bank exceeds each of these federal regulatory capital ratios. 9.  derivativesthe company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.for derivatives that are economic hedges, but are not designated as hedging instruments or otherwise do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income during the period of change.as part of interest rate risk management, the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed-rate receivables to floating rates and certain fixed-rate obligations to floating rates.the interest rate swaps are used to provide fixed rate financing while managing interest rate risk and were not designated as hedges.  the interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month libor, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. the interest rate swaps are settled quarterly and mature on june 15, 2016.   the interest rate swaps each had a notional amount of $1.8 million at june30, 2014, representing the amount of fixed-rate receivables outstanding and liabilities outstanding, and are included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair value of $106,132.   the company had a gain of $12,828 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $12,828 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended june30, 2014, and the company had a gain of $26,306 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $26,306 on the interest rate swap liability for the six months ended june30, 2014.  the company had a gain of $25,543 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $25,543 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended june30, 2013 and the company had a gain of $41,939 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $41,939 on the interest rate swap liability for the six months ended june30, 2013.  the interest rate swaps had a notional amount of $1.8 million outstanding as of december31, 2013 and were included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair market value of $132,438.  all changes in fair value are recorded as other income within non-interest income.  fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts.the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing mortgage origination business. the bank's mortgage banking segment enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.  the primary risks managed by derivative instruments are these interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments.  interest rate lock commitments are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed rate loan commitments.  the period of time between the issuance of a loan commitment and the closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 10 to 60days. such interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments represent derivative instruments which are required to be carried at fair value. these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of the company's interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the balance sheet in other assets and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.  the fair value of the company's forward sales commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.at june30, 2014, the bank had $24.3 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $39.6 million of forward commitments outstanding for original commitments and outstanding mortgage loans held-for-sale under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other liabilities was $99,962 at june30, 2014.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other assets was $230,844 at june30, 2014.  recognition of losses related to the change in fair value of forward sales commitments were $(138,840) for the three months ended june30, 2014 and are included in mortgage banking activities income. recognition of  gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments were $52,792 for the three months ended june30, 2014 and are included in mortgage banking activities income.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and losses related to forward sales commitments were $254,066 and $(247,194) for the six months ended june30, 2014, respectively, and are included in other income.  recognition of losses related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains

guaranteed, mortgage, home equity, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans.  the following table presents loans at june30, 2014

include construction and land development loans, commercial real estate loans, residential mortgages, and home equity lines of credit.commercial real estate loans totaled $620.6 million and $579.7 million at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  this lending involves loans secured by owner-occupied commercial buildings for office, storage and warehouse space, as well as non-owner occupied commercial buildings. the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt.  loans secured by commercial real estate may be larger in size and may involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties.construction/development lending totaled $127.6 million and $131.0 million at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the bank originates one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower) and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre-sold homes.  the bank generally receives a pre-arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre-sold homes; however, the bank also engages in selected speculative housing lending to existing builder clients utilizing lots that the bank has a collateral interest in.  the bank also makes commercial real estate construction loans, primarily for owner-occupied properties.  the bank limits its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 15table of contentsresidential one-to-four family loans amounted to $178.3 million and $174.1 million at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. the bank's residential mortgage loans are typically construction loans that convert into permanent financing and are secured by properties located within the bank's market areas.  home equity lines of credit totaled $197.1 million and $194.1 million at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the bank's home equity lines of credit generally are variable rate lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties with interest only payment options during a draw period.  at the end of the draw period, the line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment with repayment terms of up to 30 years.  commercial loans.  at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, the bank's commercial loan portfolio totaled $184.4 million and $185.4 million, respectively. commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital, expansion, and other business purposes.  short-term working capital loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate.  lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength, cash flow, management and credit history of the borrower, and the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  with few exceptions, the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment.  commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans.  consumer loans.  loans to individuals (consumer loans) include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans.  consumer loans totaled $46.0 million and $51.7 million at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans, even if secured, if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, and equipment.  repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan.  consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss, illness and other personal factors.  the bank manages the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss.loan approvals.  the bank's loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations.  the guidelines address the type of loans that the bank seeks, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations.  all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  these limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness to the bank, including any indebtedness as a guarantor. the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the bank.  the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by independent, outside professionals experienced in loan review.  responsibility for loan review, loan underwriting, and approval resides with the chief credit officer position. on an annual basis, the board of directors of the bank determines officers lending authority.  authorities may include loans, letters of credit, overdrafts, uncollected funds and such other authorities as determined by the board of directors.substantially all of the company's loans have been granted to customers in the piedmont, foothills, northwestern mountains, and the research triangle regions of north carolina and the upstate region of south carolina.credit review and evaluation.  the bank has a credit review department that reports to the chief credit officer.  the focus of the department is on policy compliance and proper grading of higher credit risk loans as well as new and existing loans on a sample basis. additional reporting for problem/criticized assets has been developed along with an after-the-fact loan review.  a newly expanded enterprise risk management role also performs ongoing credit review and  evaluation  to help manage and assess overall credit risk for the bank.the bank uses a risk grading program to facilitate the evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for real estate, commercial and consumer loans.  in this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers, reviewed by regional credit officers, and further reviewed by internal credit review analysts on a test basis.  the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank's market area.  every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies.  loans over $20,000 are risk graded on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 8 (loss).  acceptable loans at inception are grades 1 through 4, and these grades have underwriting requirements that at least meet the minimum requirements of a secondary market source.  if borrowers do not meet credit history requirements, other mitigating criteria such as substantial liquidity and low loan-to-value ratios could be considered and would generally have to be met in order to make the loan.  the bank's loan policy states that a guarantor may be necessary if reasonable doubt exists as to the borrower's ability to repay.  the board of directors has yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 16table of contentsauthorized the loan officers to have individual approval authority for risk grade 1 through 4 loans up to maximum exposure limits for each customer.  new or renewed loans that are graded 5 (special mention) or lower must have

loans classified as nonaccrual, foreclosed bank-owned property and loans past due 90 days or more on which interest is still being accrued.  it is the general policy of the bank to stop accruing interest for all classes of loans past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  in addition, certain restructured loans are placed on nonaccrual status until sufficient evidence of timely payment is obtained.  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period.  amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  there were no financing receivables past due over 90 days accruing interest as of june30, 2014 and december31, 2013. nonperforming loans as of june30, 2014 totaled $19.0 million, or 1.32% of total loans, compared with $15.4 million, or 1.12% of total loans, as of december31, 2013.  the bank aggressively pursues the collection and repayment of all loans. other nonperforming assets, such as repossessed and foreclosed collateral is aggressively liquidated by the bank's collection department.  the total number of loans on nonaccrual status has increased from 195 at december31, 2013 to 202 at june30, 2014. yadkin

graded 7b) or ‚Äúloss‚Äù (loans graded 8) to be individually impaired and may consider ‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù loans (loans graded 6) individually impaired depending on the borrower's payment history.  the bank measures impairment based upon probable cash flows or the value of the collateral.  collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.   updated appraisals are required for all impaired loans and typically at renewal or modification of larger loans if the appraisal is more than 12 months old. impaired loans for all classes of loans typically include nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans and other potential problem loans considered impaired based on other underlying factors.  troubled debt restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition.  interest on troubled debt restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur and a sustained payment performance period is obtained.  due to the borrowers' inability to make the payments required under the original loan terms, the bank modifies the terms by granting a longer amortized repayment structure or reduced interest rates. potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above, but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms.  these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual, past due or troubled debt restructured loans, so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  impaired loans under $250,000 are collectively reviewed for impairment based on homogeneous pools established for each class of impaired loans with similar risk characteristics in accordance with asc 310-10-35-21 and are not included with non-impaired loans.  separate loss given probability of default rates are calculated for each impaired pool representing the risk associated with impaired loans less than $250,000 for that pool of loans.  total impaired loans under $250,000 collectively evaluated were $7.8 yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014

through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management's best estimate for probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.  the primary risks inherent in the bank's loan portfolio, including the adequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses, are based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these risks, and the related loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by direct charges to provision expense. losses on loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible. recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance for loan losses. the provision for (recovery of) loan losses was $(891,000) for the quarter ended june30, 2014 as compared to $55,000 for the quarter ended june 30, 2013. the provision expense is determined by management  with the use of the bank's allowance for loan losses model. the components of the model are specific reserves for impaired loans and a general allocation for unimpaired loans.  the general allocation has two components, an estimate based on historical loss experience and an additional estimate based on internal and external environmental factors due to the uncertainty of historical loss experience in predicting current embedded losses in the portfolio that will be realized in the future.  the portion of the general allocation on environmental factors includes estimates of losses related to interest rate trends, unemployment trends, real estate characteristics, past due and nonaccrual trends, watch list trends, charge-off trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.   the real estate characteristics component includes trends in real estate concentrations, exceptions to federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") guidelines for loan-to-value ratios, and changes in real estate market values.  other factors impacting the allowance at june30, 2014 were watch list trends, unemployment rate trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 24table of contentsthe following tables present changes in the allowance for loan losses for the three

december31, 2013, respectively.  the allowance model is applied to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for unimpaired loans and impaired loans collectively evaluated grouped by loan type.  the company's loan charge-off policy for all loan classes is to charge down loans to net realizable value once a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable, and the underlying collateral shortfall is assessed.  unsecured loans (primarily consumer loans) are charged off against the reserve once the loan becomes 90 days past due or it is determined that a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  secured loans (primarily construction, real estate, commercial and other loans) are moved to nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable and supporting collateral is not considered to be sufficient to cover potential losses.  nonaccrual loans are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if all or a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  nonaccrual loans that are determined to be solely collateral dependent are promptly charged down to net realizable value upon determination that they are impaired.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 27table of contentsin addition to the allowance for loan losses, the company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments. unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by loan classification. these classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the reserve for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $109,369 and $116,309 as of june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the company maintains reserves for mortgage loans sold to agencies and investors in the event that, either through error or disagreement between the parties, the company is required to indemnify the purchase. the reserves take into consideration risks associated with underwriting, key factors in the mortgage industry, loans with specific reserve requirements, past due loans and potential indemnification by the company. reserves are estimated based on consideration of factors in the mortgage industry such as declining collateral values and rising levels of delinquency, default and foreclosure, coupled with increased incidents of quality reviews at all levels of the mortgage industry seeking justification for pushing back losses to loan originators and wholesalers. as of june30, 2014, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $202,080, and charges against reserves for the three months ended june30, 2014 were $2,182.   for the three months ended june30, 2014, the company recorded $7,512 in recapture of provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $36.8 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  for the three months ended june 30, 2013, the company recorded $3,898  in provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure.  there were no charges against reserves for the three months ended june 30, 2013.  for the six months ended june30, 2014, the company recorded $12,424 in recapture of provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure and charges against reserves were $2,182.   for the six months ended june30, 2013, the company recorded $1.3 million in recapture of provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure and charges against reserves were $83,198.  reduction in provisions for the three months ended june 30, 2013 were the result of decreased mortgage activity, improvements in historical loss experience, and declines in specific reserves as claims were paid and settled from previously established reserves.   for the three and six ended june30, 2014 and 2013, the company did not repurchase any mortgage loans sold.  as of december31, 2013, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $216,687 related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure.11. fair valuethe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. available-for-sale securities, interest rate swaps, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and forward sale loan commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, from time to time, the company may be required to record other assets at fair value, such as loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments usually involve writing the asset down to fair value or the lower of cost or market value. following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. available-for-sale investment securitiesavailable-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, u.s. treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.interest rate swapsinterest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models run by a third-party on a monthly basis.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.   as a result, the company classifies interest rate swaps as level 3.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 28table of contentsthe following table presents a rollforward of interest rate

lock commitments and sale commitments was $(23,000) and $147,000, respectively.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the company classifies interest rate lock commitments as level 3.  the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end.  the company classified forward sale commitments as level 2.  there have been no

loans are pooled together and evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings.  the present value of the future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool, calculated by a third party at least semi-annually, using assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing.   as such, the company classifies loan servicing rights as a  level 3 asset. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent

carried at lower of cost or market value. the fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. the changes in fair value of the assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.  as such, the company classifies loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a level 2 asset.  at june30, 2014, the cost of the company's mortgage loans held-for-sale was less than the market value.  accordingly, the company's loans held-for-sale are carried at cost. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.impaired loansthe company does not record loans held-for-investment at fair value on a recurring basis. however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs), market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. at june30, 2014, the majority of impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral by obtaining third-party appraisals and applying liquidity discounts.  third party appraisals are obtained at least annually for all impaired loans greater than $250,000.  the company records impaired loans as nonrecurring level 3. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.other real estate ownedother real estate owned (‚Äúoreo‚Äù) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to oreo. subsequently, oreo is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs). when the fair value of the collateral is measured due to further deterioration in the value of the oreo since initial recognition, the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level 3. the current carrying value of oreo at june30, 2014 is $2.3 million.  at december31, 2013 the carrying value of oreo was $3.3 million. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and six months ended june30, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.yadkin financial

in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate swap agreements is the discount rate. a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. the discount rate is determined by the third-party by obtaining third party market quotes from reuters, which handle up to 30 year swap maturities.  the company's asset liability management team periodically reviews the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate lock commitments is the pull through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments to increase if in a gain position, or decrease if in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company's mortgage banking division.the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the company's mortgage servicing rights are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions.  the company utilizes an independent third-party to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through use of a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income based on observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at yadkin financial

determined using the following methodologies for each financial instrument class except that the fair value methodology for june 30, 2014 is consistent with the fair values used in the previously disclosed vantagesouth business combination transaction in the areas of loans receivable, demand deposits, time deposits, and borrowing as follows:‚Ä¢the fair value was estimated based on the estimated lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio, and the present value of the differences between contractual interest rates and market interest rates.‚Ä¢the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts represents the estimated fair value premium on time deposits which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. ‚Ä¢the fair values of borrowings are based on the estimated fair value of borrowings, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate. this fair value premium is also consistent with the prepayment penalty the fhlb would charge to terminate the advance.the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value.the fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices, prices quoted for similar instruments, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the fhlb stock.the carrying values of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair values due to the short-term duration.interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.interest rate locks and forward loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing release premium, origination income net of origination costs, and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.as of december 31, 2013, for certain categories of loans, such as installment and commercial loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. the cost of fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale approximates the lower of cost or market as these loans are typically sold within 60 days of origination. fair values for adjustable-rate mortgages are based on quoted market prices of similar loans adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  the company applied an additional illiquidity discount in the amount of 5.0%.the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at december31, 2013.  the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts is estimated using the present value of the projected cash flows using rates currently offered for similar deposits with similar maturities.the fair values of borrowings as of december 31, 2013 are based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate for debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements. the carrying values of short-term borrowings, including overnight, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and fhlb advances, approximates the fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments.  the company's credit risk is not material to calculation of fair value because these borrowings are collateralized. yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014

$17.0 million at june30, 2014 and $23.4 million at december 31, 2013.     in evaluating whether the company will realize the full benefit of its net deferred tax asset, it considers both positive and negative evidence, including recent earnings trends and projected earnings, asset quality, and other significant events.  a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. as of june 30, 2014, the company returned to a cumulative pretax income position excluding goodwill impairment for the three-year period ending june30, 2014 of $18.9 million and the company is projecting income on a pretax basis, as well as taxable income, for the future periods 2014 through 2016. credit quality has also improved dramatically over the past two years, including significant decreases in classified loans and nonperforming loans. after review of all available evidence and based on the weight of such evidence, the company believes the realization of the deferred tax asset  is, more likely than not and no valuation allowance is deemed necessary at june30, 2014 based primarily on a return to profitability, pretax income trends, projected pretax income for the years 2014 through 2016 and improving credit quality metrics.june 30, 2014cumulative loss test2011*201220132014**totalincome (loss) before income taxes$8,777$(32,635)$29,227$13,513$18,882goodwill

six months ended june30, 2014  and 2013 and also analyzes our financial condition as of june30, 2014 as compared to december31, 2013.  like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments.  our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.  consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.  another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.  we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings.  in the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.  we describe the various components of this noninterest income, as well as our noninterest expense, in the following discussion.the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements.  we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 43table of contentsthe company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or occurrences after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.in 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and filed an amendment to both the company's and the bank's articles of incorporation changing their name to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new stock symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to  share data have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.recent eventson july 4, 2014, the company completed the merger of vantagesouth bancshares, inc. (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù) and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù) with and into the company (the ‚Äúmergers‚Äù). the mergers were completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 27, 2014, by and among the company, vantagesouth and piedmont (as amended, the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù). at closing, vantagesouth and piedmont merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving corporation. immediately following the mergers, vantagesouth bank, a north carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of vantagesouth, was merged with and into the bank, with the bank continuing as the surviving bank. pursuant to the merger agreement, each outstanding share of vantagesouth common stock (other than shares held by piedmont, which were cancelled) was converted into the right to receive 0.3125 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock. each outstanding share of piedmont common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) 6.28597 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock; (ii) $6.6878 in cash; and (iii) a right to receive a pro rata portion of certain shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock at a later date if such shares do not become payable under the piedmont phantom equity plan. the piedmont phantom plan, which is a type of deferred compensation plan, has been assumed by the company. a total of 856,447 shares of the company‚Äôs voting common stock that otherwise would have been issued to piedmont stockholders as merger consideration if the piedmont phantom equity plan did not exist has been issued to a rabbi trust established by the company to serve as a source of payment for both (i) payments due under the piedmont phantom equity plan and (ii) contingent merger consideration payable to former holders of piedmont common stock. the company issued approximately [17,268,805] shares of voting common stock in connection with the mergers, which represents [55.7]% of the voting interests in the company. effective july 4, 2014, the company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common stock to 75,000,000, with a par value of $1.00 per share.  on july 7, 2014, the company‚Äôs voting common stock began trading on the nyse under the stock symbol ‚Äúydkn.‚Äù  the company‚Äôs voting common stock previously traded on the nasdaq global select market under the same stock symbol, ‚Äúydkn.‚Äùchanges in financial

losses, was $1,403.4 million compared to $1,340.7 million at december31, 2013, an increase of 4.7%.  gross loans held-for-investment increased by $61.1 million, or 4.5% as loan production has increased.  the allowance for loan losses decreased $1.6 million driven primarily by decreases in classified loans for the quarter ended june30, 2014 and decreased historical losses in 2014 as compared to 2013. total watch list and substandard loans were $75.5 million as compared to $84.4 million as of december31, 2013, a decrease of $9.0 million.   see note 10 above entitled ‚Äúloans and allowance for loan losses‚Äù for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses.mortgage loans held-for-sale decreased by $3.2 million, or 17.0%, from december31, 2013 to june30, 2014 as the bank continued its strategy of selling mortgage loans mostly to various investors with servicing rights released and to a lesser extent to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation with servicing rights retained.   these loans are normally held for a period of two to three weeks before being sold to investors.  mortgage loans closed in the first six months of 2014 ranged from a low of $9.3 million in february 2014 to a high of $18.5 million in may 2014 and totaled $81.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2014.  mortgage loans closed during the six months ended june 30, 2013 totaled $151.4 million.   decrease in mortgage activity, including refinance activity, is the result of an increase in rates and volatility.the securities portfolio decreased from $288.9 million at december31, 2013, to $259.1 million at june30, 2014, a decrease of $29.8 million, or 10.3%, due to paydowns and maturities of $16.8 million and sales of $20.4 million in 2014, offset by purchases of $5.0 million.  the portfolio is comprised of securities of u.s. government agencies (6.3%), mortgage-backed securities (60.8%), state and municipal securities (31.7%), and publicly traded common and preferred stocks (1.2%).  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 44table of contentsother assets increased slightly by $11,000 or 0.11% from december 31, 2013 to june 30, 2014.  oreo decreased $996,000 as the result of sales in the amount of $1.2 million and $117,000 in writedowns, offset by transfers in the amount of $357,000 for the six months ended june30, 2014.  premises and equipment decreased $494,000, or 1.21% due to depreciation of $1.3 million offset by additions of $847,000.  deferred tax assets also decreased $6.5 million as the company recorded $13.5 million in income before taxes for the year 2014, utilizing net operating loss carryforwards.  see note 14 for detailed information regarding deferred tax assets.deposits increased $8.8 million, or 0.6%, comparing june30, 2014 to december31, 2013. overall, noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $29.3 million, or 10.9%, and now, savings, and money market accounts increased $3.7 million, or 0.5%.  certificates of deposit (‚Äúcods‚Äù) over $100,000 decreased $11.0 million, or 4.8%, and other cods decreased $30.8 million, or 9.4%.   management continues to focus on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand and now accounts through the use of marketing efforts and interest rates.borrowed funds increased $19.6 million, or 22.0%, comparing june30, 2014 to december31, 2013 due to $20 million in additional short-term advances from the fhlb.  short-term borrowings include $47.0 million in fhlb advances and $25.8 million in repurchase agreements.  long term borrowings included $35.0 million in trust preferred securities and advances from the fhlb of $893,000. the merger with american community bancshares, inc.  ("american community") added $10.4 million in trust preferred securities in 2007 at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.80% and will mature in 2033.  yadkin valley statutory trust i (‚Äúthe trust‚Äù) issued $25.8 million in trust preferred securities in 2007 at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 1.32%. the trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, and can be called by the trust without penalty. other liabilities, capital lease obligations and accrued interest payable combined decreased by $3.2 million, or 23.1%, from december31, 2013 to june30, 2014.  decreases in other liabilities resulted primarily from a $2.5 million decrease in accrued incentive expense as 2013 accruals were paid out in the first quarter of 2014.  at december 31, 2013 other liabilities also included a $1.7 million payable for a security purchase which was settled in january 2014. at june30, 2014, total shareholders' equity was $193.8 million, or a book value of $11.50 per common share, compared to $184.5 million, or a book value of $10.85 per common share, at december31, 2013.  the company's equity to assets ratio was 10.63% and 10.21%, at june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  in order to be considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù, a bank must exceed total risk-based capital ratios of 10%, and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6% and leverage ratios of 5%.  our goal has been to maintain a ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù status for the bank since failure to meet or exceed this classification affects how regulatory applications for certain activities, including acquisitions, and continuation and expansion of existing activities, are evaluated and could make our customers and potential investors less confident in our bank. the following table sets forth the company's and the bank's various capital ratios as of june30, 2014 and december31, 2013.  the company and the bank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios as of june30, 2014, as well as the ratios to be considered "well capitalized."  june 30, 2014december 31,

critical aspect of capital management in any business.  the determination of the appropriate amount of equity for a regulated financial institution is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the amount of capital needed to meet regulatory requirements, the amount of ‚Äúrisk equity‚Äù the business requires and balance sheet leverage.in july 2013, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the ‚Äúfederal reserve‚Äù) and the fdic approved final rules to implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, among other changes required by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. the rules will apply to all national and state banks, such as the bank, and savings associations and most  bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, such as the company, which we collectively refer to herein as yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 45table of contentscovered banking organizations.  bank holding companies with less than $500 million in total consolidated assets are not subject to the final rule, nor are savings and loan holding companies substantially engaged in commercial activities or insurance underwriting.  the framework requires covered banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, taking into account the impact of risk. the approved rules include a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as well as a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. the rules also raise the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all covered banking institutions.  in terms of quality of capital, the final rules emphasize common equity tier 1 capital and implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. the rules also change the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. the changes begin to take effect for the company and the bank in january 2015.  the ultimate impact of the new capital standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed.  liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market riskthe bank derives the majority of its liquidity from its core deposit base and to a lesser extent from wholesale borrowing.  the balance sheet liquidity ratio, measured by the sum of cash (less reserve requirements), investments, and loans held-for-sale reduced by pledged securities, as compared to deposits and short-term borrowings, was 13.0% at june30, 2014 compared to 15.4% at december 31, 2013.  additional liquidity is provided by $124.8 million in unused credit including federal funds purchased lines provided by correspondent banks as well as credit availability from the fhlb. in addition, the bank has unpledged marketable securities of $152.7 million available for use as a source of collateral.  at june30, 2014, brokered deposits totaled $33.0 million, or 2.18% of total deposits.  brokered certificates of deposit are primarily short-term with maturities of nine months or less.  the bank also maintains a brokered deposit now account to add municipal deposits totaling $1,299 at june30, 2014.  the bank contracted with promontory interfinancial network ("promontory") in 2008 for various services including wholesale cod funding. promontory's cdars¬Æ product, one-way buysm, enables the bank to bid on a weekly basis through a private auction for cod terms ranging from four weeks to 260weeks (approximately five years) with settlement available each thursday.  there were no outstanding funds acquired through the one-way buy product at june30, 2014 or december 31, 2013. promontory also provides a product, cdars¬Æ reciprocal, which allows the bank's customers to place funds in excess of the fdic insurance limit with promontory's network of participating banks so that the customer is fully insured for the amount deposited. promontory provides reciprocating funds to the bank from funds placed at other banks by their customers. the bank sets its customers' interest rates when they place deposits through the network and pays/receives the rate difference to/from the other banks whose reciprocal funds are held by the bank. the overall impact of this process is that the bank effectively pays the rate offered to its relationship customer. therefore, the bank does not consider these funds to be wholesale or brokered funds. in compliance with fdic reporting requirements, the bank includes reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits in its quarterly federal financial institutions examination council call report.  cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits totaled $165,000 at december 31, 2013.  there were no cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits outstanding at june 30, 2014.management continues to assess interest rate risk internally and by utilizing outside sources.  the balance sheet is asset sensitive over a three-month period, meaning that there will be more assets than liabilities immediately repricing as market rates change. over a period of twelve months, the balance sheet remains slightly asset sensitive. we generally would benefit from increasing market interest rates when we have an asset-sensitive, or a positive interest rate gap, and we would generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we have liability-sensitive, or a negative interest rate gap.  the company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.  the company's exposure to market risk is reviewed regularly by management.results of operationsnet income for the quarter ended june30,

with $16.1 million in the same period of 2013.  the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 24.6% as average interest bearing deposits are down 4.5% from the prior year and deposit costs are declining as time deposits continue to reprice at lower rates.   the net interest margin increased to 4.0% in the second quarter of 2014 from 3.9% in the second quarter of 2013.    the increase in net interest margin is primarily related to a decrease in deposit yields and borrowings cost as well as an increase in yields on securities.  deposit yields have decreased as management focused efforts on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing now and money market accounts.  the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of changing rates on net interest income.  net interest income increased $2.0 million, or 6.5%, to $33.2 million for the six months ended june 30, 2014, compared with $31.2 million in the same period in 2013.  the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of

other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses was $16.4 million at june30, 2014, or 1.16% of loans held-for-investment, as compared to $18.1 million, or 1.33% of loans held-for-investment, at december31, 2013.  decreases in the allowance for loan losses were due to yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 48table of contentsdecreased historical loss rates and decreased criticized loans in the first six months of 2014.  while nonperforming loans have increased thus increasing specific allowances, loans collectively evaluated continue to show improvement in past due levels and  performance.  in addition, loan growth has been concentrated in loan portfolio types with lower historical losses including commercial real estate and secured one-to-four family residential mortgages, while higher risk portfolios (with high historical losses) have been decreasing thus leading to decreased reserves levels for the overall portfolio.  the allowance model is applied to the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for performing loans grouped by loan type.  out of the $16.4 million in total allowance for loan losses at june30, 2014, the specific allowance for impaired loans accounted for $2.0 million, up from $557,000 at year end.  see discussion below in "nonperforming assets" for further discussion of nonaccrual relationships.  the remaining general allowance, $14.4 million, was attributed to performing loans and was down from $17.5 million at year end.  the general allowance, as a percent of loans not individually reviewed for impairment was 1.03% as of june30, 2014 as compared to 1.31% as of december31, 2013.  the decrease in the general allowance was driven primarily by a decrease in historical loss rates, as well as a decrease in substandard and watch loans of $9.0 million which resulted from a few significant payoffs and improvements in underlying credit exposures of previously classified loans.  net loan recoveries were $818,707, or 0.23% (annualized), of average loans, for the three months ended june30, 2014 compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.6 million, or 0.49% (annualized), of average loans for the three months ended june 30, 2013.  net loan charge-offs were $262,352, or 0.04% (annualized), of average loans, for the six months ended june30, 2014 compared to net loan charge-offs of $2.5 million, or 0.38% (annualized), of average loans for the six months ended june 30, 2013.  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the bank's loan portfolio as of june30, 2014. no assurance can be given in this regard, however, especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in the bank's market areas. management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and will consider future changes to the allowance that may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions.  additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the bank's allowance for loan losses.  such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses. the downturn experienced in the real estate market from 2008 through 2011 resulted in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures.  in some cases, that downturn resulted in significant impairments to the value of collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.  management aggressively monitors its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with significant weaknesses.  the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. if real estate values begin to decline in the future, it is more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and our net charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. assurances cannot be made either (1) that further charges to the allowance account will not be significant in relation to the normal activity or (2) that further evaluation of the loan portfolio based on prevailing conditions may not require sizable additions to the allowance and charges to provision expense. our real estate portfolio has approximately $127.6 million of construction loans, $620.6 million of commercial real estate loans, $178.3 million in first lien mortgage loans, $197.1 million in home equity lines of credit and $64.8 million in multifamily mortgage loans as of june30, 2014. we consider our construction and junior lien mortgage loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio.  construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed into properties such as sub-divisions or speculative houses. normally, these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the developed property.  in addition, management continues to evaluate closely junior lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.  given the slow economic recovery, and real estate values that have been slow to recover, the company recognizes that it may experience some loss in these portfolios, and management continues to monitor borrower financials,  ltvs, and first lien positions.   the significance of both construction and commercial real estate loans to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due.   loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.   as of june30, 2014, $3.7 million of our real estate loans had interest reserves including both borrower and bank funded, compared to $7.7 million as of december31, 2013.  there is a risk that an interest reserve could mask problems with a borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt consistent with the terms and conditions of the loan obligation, therefore the company has implemented review policies and internal controls to identify and monitor all loans with interest reserves.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 49table of contentsnonperforming assetstotal nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due but still accruing, and foreclosed real estate) increased 13.9%from $18.7 million at december31, 2013 to $21.3 million at june30, 2014 due primarily to an increase in nonperforming loans.  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 1.17% as of june30, 2014 as compared to 0.99% as of december31, 2013.  total nonaccrual loans increased from $15.4 million, or 1.12% of total loans, at december 31, 2013 to $19.0 million, or 1.32% of total loans, at june30, 2014 due primarily to the addition of two large nonaccrual relationships.    the largest nonaccrual relationship totaled $2.2 million as of june 30, 2014 and consists of two loans. one loan was originally used to refinance an owner-occupied commercial office building and the other loan was a discretionary line of credit used for investments and other expenses. the line of credit was secured by three residential lots and was charged down to fair market value during the first quarter of 2014. the first loan is secured by a commercial office building and does not have a specific reserve assigned to it as of june 30, 2014.  nonaccrual loans also included two other large relationships totaling $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2014. the first relationship consists of a loan utilized to consolidate existing debt with the bank and is secured by an assignment of a brokerage account. there is a reserve in the approximate amount of $541,000 assigned to it as of june 30, 2014.  the second relationship was also utilized to consolidate existing debt with the bank with additional funds used to complete the construction of a 1-4 family residential dwelling. the loan is secured by a first deed of trust on the borrower‚Äôs primary residence and has a reserve in the approximate amount of $548,000 assigned to it as of june 30, 2014. all of these loans have been placed in nonaccrual status because of concerns for the customers' continued ability to pay, collateral deterioration and the future industry outlook.approximately 38% of loans in nonaccrual status are currently not past due 30 days or more. the total number of loans on nonaccrual has increased from 195 to 202 since december 31, 2013. the average nonaccrual loan balance was $94,000 and $79,000 as of june30, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. at june30, 2014, 83% of the nonaccrual loans were secured by real estate.we have analyzed our nonperforming loans to determine what we believe is the amount needed to reserve in the allowance for loan losses based on an assessment of the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan.   we have downgraded loans for which the probability of collection is uncertain and written down oreo property values where net realizable values have declined. noninterest incomenoninterest income consists of all revenues that are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets.  total noninterest income decreased approximately $2.7 million, or 43.5%, comparing the second quarters of 2014 and 2013 as mortgage banking income decreased $1.8 million, or 70.1% which resulted from decreased mortgage activity.   other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $74,000, or 5.6%, due primarily to a $115,000 decrease in nsf (non-sufficient funds) and odp (overdraft privilege charges).  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in service charges on now and money market accounts, business checking accounts, and regular checking accounts of $43,000 as checking and savings accounts have increased $55.0 million since june 30, 2013.  ‚Ä¢other service fees decreased $137,000 when comparing the second quarter of 2013 to 2014 due to a $423,000 decrease in annuity and mutual fund commissions.  this decrease was partially offset by a $107,000 increase in investment service fees and an increase of $157,000 in atm and debit card fee income as incentive fees related to the signing of a new contract in 2012 are earned over the life of the contract.  ‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities decreased $269,000 as fewer securities were sold during the second quarter of

income decreased $2.8 million, or 60.8% which resulted from decreased mortgage activity.   other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $119,000, or  4.6%, due primarily to a $235,000 decrease in nsf  and odp.  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in service charges on now and money market accounts, business checking accounts, and regular checking accounts of $115,000  as checking and savings accounts have increased $55 million since june 30, 2013.  ‚Ä¢other service fees decreased $38,000, or 1.6% when comparing  2013 to 2014 due to a $443,000 decrease in annuity and mutual fund commissions.  this decrease was partially offset by a $101,000 increase in investment service fees and an increase of $285,000 in atm and debit card fee income as incentive fees related to the signing of a new contract in 2012 are earned over the life of the contract.  ‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities increased $855,000, or 309.8%, as $20.4 million in investments were sold during the first six months of 2014 resulting in gains on sale of $1.1 million, as compared to gains on sales of investment

addition, provisions for (recovery of) sold mortgage loans  also decreased $1.3 million due to a recovery of provision recorded for the first quarter of 2013 as mortgage activity decreased significantly due to exit of wholesale markets and the dissolution of sidus.  ‚Ä¢other income decreased by approximately $317,000, or 57.3%, for the six months ended june 30, 2014.  this decrease is primarily due to additional income recorded from the reversal of contingency reserve accounts in the second quarter of 2013 that were established for the de-risk transaction which occurred in late

decrease in fdic expense, advertising expense, and loan collection fees.  these decreases were partially offset by additional merger expenses in the amount of $649,000 recorded during the second quarter of 2014.   noninterest expense also includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and all other operating costs.  noninterest expense to average assets for the quarter ended june30, 2014 and 2013 was 0.78%, and 0.70%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the three months ended june30, 2014 and 2013 were 64.89% and 66.39%, respectively.    the efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expenses excluding merger expenses, less amortization of intangibles and gains on sale of other real estate owned to the total of the taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income.  the following is a summary of the fluctuations for the three and six months ended june30, 2014 as compared to june30, 2013:‚Ä¢quarter-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses decreased by $586,000, or 7.4%.  the major components of this decrease are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased $324,000 due to annual increases and addition of new

and 38.6%, respectively, as compared to 35.1% and 35.5% for the three and six months ended june30, 2013.  increase in the effective tax rate is due to certain merger expenses incurred in the first half of 2014 that are not deductible for tax purposes.  see footnote 14 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense and deferred tax assets.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 52table of contentsitem 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskmarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending, deposit, and borrowing activities.  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  in addition to other risks that we manage in the normal course of business, such as credit quality and liquidity, management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could potentially have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  the information contained in item 2 in the section captioned "liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market risk" is incorporated herein by reference.  other types of market risks, such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities.  the acquisition of american community and expansion into new market areas in north and south carolina have marketing risks that are mitigated by retaining the american community brand name in these markets.  credit risk associated with loans acquired in the merger are part of the overall discussion of credit risk in the sections captioned ‚Äúprovision and allowance for loan losses‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-performing assets.‚Äùthe primary objective of asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk and achieve reasonable stability in net interest income throughout interest rate cycles.  this is achieved by maintaining the proper balance of rate-sensitive earning assets and rate-sensitive interest-bearing liabilities.  the relationship of rate-sensitive earning assets to rate-sensitive interest-bearing liabilities is the principal factor in projecting the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on future net interest income.  rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period. management monitors the rate sensitivity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over the entire life of these instruments, but places particular emphasis on the next twelve months.  following a period of rate increases (or decreases) net interest income will increase (or decrease) over both a three-month and a twelve-month period.item 4.  controls and proceduresas of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective (1)to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the securities exchange act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and (2)to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.changes in internal control over financial reportingthere were no changes in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. the company reviews its disclosure controls and procedures, which may include its internal control over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the company's systems evolve with its business.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2014 53table of contentspart ii. other informationitem 1. legal proceedingswe are not a party to, nor are any

presentationthe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation  (the "company") and its subsidiary, yadkin bank (the "bank").  the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial statements and with instructions to form 10-q and regulation s-x.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for complete financial statements.  because the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included with the company's 2012 annual report on form 10-k (the "2012 form 10-k") filed with the securities and exchange commission (‚Äúsec‚Äù) on february 28, 2013.  operating results, for the three months ended march31, 2014, do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the year or other interim periods.in the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments, all of which are normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of march31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three

expenses reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.  reclassifications include certain loan collection and occupancy expenses that were previously recorded in other expenses that have now been reclassified to loan collection fees and occupancy expense.  effective may 28, 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split.   all outstanding options and restricted shares  and earnings per share calculations have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split. the reclassifications above had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.2. new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardsin 2013, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-04, "receivables (topic 310): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure" ("asu 2014-04").  the asu clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs upon either the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. the amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. the amendments may be adopted using either a modified retrospective transition method or a prospective transition method. early adoption is permitted. management does not believe the amendments will have a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31,

million and $107.4 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively, were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.the following table presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of investment securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013. securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at march31, 2014 include one u.s. government agency, two mortgage-backed securities, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation, and 13 state and municipal securities.  the key factors considered in evaluating the collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 10table of contentsand municipal securities were cash flows of the investment and the assessment of other relative economic factors, such as credit risk.  securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at december31, 2013 include one u.s. government agency, one collateralized mortgage obligation, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and nine state and municipal securities.   the unrealized losses relate to securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to a shift in demand from non-governmental securities and municipals to u.s. treasury bonds and governmental agencies due to market concerns. the unrealized losses are not likely to reverse unless market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. none of the unrealized losses relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer's ability to honor redemption obligations.  it is not more likely than not that the company will have to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. for the three months ended march31, 2014, there were no securities available-for-sale deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (‚Äúotti‚Äù).   if management determines that an investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment, the loss is recognized in the income statement. less than 12 months12 months or moretotalmarch31, 2014fair valueunrealizedlossesfair valueunrealizedlossesfair

cost of the company's cost method investments totaled $4,591,749 at march31, 2014 and $5,283,254 at december31, 2013.  cost method investments at march31, 2014 include $2,788,800 in federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock and $1,802,949 of investments in various trust and financial companies, which are included in other assets.  all cost method investments were evaluated for impairment at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013.  the following factors have been considered in determining the carrying amount of fhlb stock: 1) the recoverability of the par value, 2) the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all operational needs in the foreseeable future and would not need to dispose of the stock below recorded amounts, 3) redemptions and purchases of the stock are at the discretion of the fhlb, 4) the company believes the fhlb has the ability to absorb economic losses given the expectation that the various fhlbs' have a high degree of government support, and 5) the unrealized losses related to securities owned by the fhlb are manageable given the capital levels of the organization.   during the three months ended march31, 2013, the company's investment in a financial services company was considered to be other than temporarily impaired and approximately $39,185 was charged-off.    there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three months ended march31, 2014.    6.  commitments and contingenciesin the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  at march31, 2014, the company had commitments outstanding of $321.5 million  for additional loan amounts.  commitments of the bank's mortgage lending department are excluded from this amount and discussed in the paragraph below.  additional commitments totaling $6.7 million were outstanding under standby letters of credit.  management does not expect any significant losses to result from these commitments. at march31, 2014, the bank had $26.0 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $32.8 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  see note 9 for additional disclosures on these derivative financial instruments.7.    earnings per common sharebasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting periods.  diluted net income available to common shareholders per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  the numerators of the basic net income per common share computations are the same as the numerators of the diluted net income per common share computations for all the periods presented.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended march31, 2014 excludes 163,783 shares of unvested restricted stock.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended march 31, 2013 excludes 175,873 shares of unvested restricted stock.  a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computations to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computations is as follows:three months endedmarch 31,20142013basic eps denominator:weighted average number of common shares

because the exercise prices exceeded the average market price per share.  the non-dilutive options had exercise prices ranging from $20.37 to $57.21 per share for the three months ended march 31, 2014. during the quarter ended march 31, 2014, 106,966 shares of restricted stock were not considered dilutive because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method or because performance and service criteria had not been met.  during the three months ended march 31, 2013, there were 84,889 warrants and stock options that were not considered dilutive, and 187,196 shares of restricted stock that were not considered dilutive. yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 12table of contentseffective may 28, 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock

2012, north carolina passed the banking modernization act, pursuant to section 53c-4-7 of which, the bank, as a north carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends if such distributions will not reduce its capital below its applicable ‚Äúrequired capital.‚Äù the bank's ‚Äúrequired capital‚Äù is that amount of capital required for the bank to be deemed ‚Äúadequately capitalized‚Äù under applicable federal regulatory capital ratios.  currently, the bank exceeds each of these federal regulatory capital ratios. during the second quarter of 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and filed amendments to the company's and the bank's articles of incorporation changing their names to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to net income per share and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for the effect of the reverse stock split.9.  derivativesthe company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.for derivatives that are economic hedges, but are not designated as hedging instruments or otherwise do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income during the period of change.as part of interest rate risk management, the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed-rate receivables to floating rates and certain fixed-rate obligations to floating rates.the interest rate swaps are used to provide fixed rate financing while managing interest rate risk and were not designated as hedges.  the interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month libor, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. the interest rate swaps are settled quarterly and mature on june 15, 2016.   the interest rate swaps each had a notional amount of $1.8 million at march31, 2014, representing the amount of fixed-rate receivables outstanding and liabilities outstanding, and are included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair value of $118,960.   the company had a gain of $13,478 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $13,478 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended march31, 2014.  the company had a gain of $16,395 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $16,395 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  the interest rate swaps had a notional amount of $1.8 million outstanding as of december31, 2013 and were included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair market value of $132,438.  all changes in fair value are recorded as other income within non-interest income.  fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts.the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing mortgage origination business. the bank's mortgage banking segment enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.  the primary risks managed by derivative instruments are these interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments.  interest rate lock commitments are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed rate loan commitments.  the period of time between the issuance of a loan commitment and the closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 10 to 60days. such interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments represent derivative instruments which are required to be carried at fair value. these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of the company's interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the balance sheet in other assets and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.  the fair value of the company's forward sales commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.at march31, 2014, the bank had $26.0 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $32.8 million of forward commitments outstanding for original commitments and outstanding mortgage loans held-for-sale under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other assets was $38,878 at march31, 2014.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other assets was $178,052 at march31, 2014.  recognition of losses related to the change in fair value of forward sales commitments yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 13table of contentswere

rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $(65,931) and $55,586 for the three months ended march31, 2013, respectively, and are included in other income.   at december31, 2013, the bank had $13.4 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $31.9 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other assets was $147,232 and the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other liabilities was $23,222 at december31, 2013.10. loans and allowance for loan lossesgeneral.  the bank provides to its customers a full range of short- to medium-term commercial, agricultural, small business administration guaranteed, mortgage, home equity, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans.  the following table presents loans at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013 by class:march 31,december 31,20142013(in thousands)construction and land development$124,946$131,035commercial real

net$1,366,176$1,340,683real estate loans.  real estate loans include construction and land development loans, commercial real estate loans, residential mortgages, and home equity lines of credit.commercial real estate loans totaled $592.9 million and $579.7 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  this lending involves loans secured by owner-occupied commercial buildings for office, storage and warehouse space, as well as non-owner occupied commercial buildings. the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt.  loans secured by commercial real estate may be larger in size and may involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties.construction/development lending totaled $124.9 million and $131.0 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the bank originates one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower) and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre-sold homes.  the bank generally receives a pre-arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre-sold homes; however, the bank also engages in selected speculative housing lending to existing builder clients utilizing lots that the bank has a collateral interest in.  the bank also makes commercial real estate construction loans, primarily yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 14table of contentsfor owner-occupied properties.  the bank limits its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures.  residential one-to-four family loans amounted to $180.1 million and $174.1 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. the bank's residential mortgage loans are typically construction loans that convert into permanent financing and are secured by properties located within the bank's market areas.  home equity lines of credit totaled $192.8 million and $194.1 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the bank's home equity lines of credit generally are variable rate lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties with interest only payment options during a draw period.  at the end of the draw period, the line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment with repayment terms of up to 30 years.  commercial loans.  at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, the bank's commercial loan portfolio totaled $183.8 million and $185.4 million, respectively. commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital, expansion, and other business purposes.  short-term working capital loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate.  lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength, cash flow, management and credit history of the borrower, and the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  with few exceptions, the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment.  commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans.  consumer loans.  loans to individuals (consumer loans) include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans.  consumer loans totaled $44.7 million and $51.7 million at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans, even if secured, if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, and equipment.  repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan.  consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss, illness and other personal factors.  the bank manages the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss.loan approvals.  the bank's loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations.  the guidelines address the type of loans that the bank seeks, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations.  all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  these limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness to the bank, including any indebtedness as a guarantor. the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the bank.  the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by independent, outside professionals experienced in loan review.  responsibility for loan review, loan underwriting, and approval resides with the chief credit officer position. on an annual basis, the board of directors of the bank determines officers lending authority.  authorities may include loans, letters of credit, overdrafts, uncollected funds and such other authorities as determined by the board of directors.substantially all of the company's loans have been granted to customers in the piedmont, foothills, northwestern mountains, and the research triangle regions of north carolina and the upstate region of south carolina.credit review and evaluation.  the bank has a credit review department that reports to the chief credit officer.  the focus of the department is on policy compliance and proper grading of higher credit risk loans as well as new and existing loans on a sample basis. additional reporting for problem/criticized assets has been developed along with an after-the-fact loan review.  a newly expanded enterprise risk management role also performs ongoing credit review and  evaluation  to help manage and assess overall credit risk for the bank.the bank uses a risk grading program to facilitate the evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for real estate, commercial and consumer loans.  in this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers, reviewed by regional credit officers, and further reviewed by internal credit review analysts on a test basis.  the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank's market area.  every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies.  loans over $20,000 are risk graded on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 8 (loss).  acceptable loans at inception are grades 1 through 4, and these grades have underwriting requirements that at least meet the minimum requirements of a secondary market yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 15table of contentssource.  if borrowers do not meet credit history requirements, other mitigating criteria such as substantial liquidity and low loan-to-value ratios could be considered and would generally have to be met in order to make the loan.  the bank's loan policy states that a guarantor may be necessary if reasonable doubt exists as to the borrower's ability to repay.  the board of directors has authorized the loan officers to have individual approval authority for risk grade 1 through 4 loans up to maximum exposure limits for each customer.  new or renewed loans that are graded 5 (special mention) or lower must have approval from a regional credit officer. any changes in risk assessments as determined by loan officers, credit administrators, regulatory examiners and management are also considered.  the risk grades, normally assigned by the loan officers when the loan is originated and reviewed by the regional credit officers, are based on several factors including historical data, current economic factors, composition of the portfolio, and evaluations of the total loan portfolio and assessments of credit quality within specific loan types.  in some cases, the risk grades are assigned by regional executives, depending upon dollar exposure.  because these factors are dynamic, the provision for loan losses can fluctuate.  credit quality reviews are based primarily on analysis of borrowers' cash flows, with asset values considered only as a second source of payment.   regional credit officers work with lenders in underwriting, structuring and risk grading the bank's credits.  the risk review officer focuses on lending policy compliance, credit risk grading, and credit risk reviews on larger dollar exposures.  management uses the information developed from the procedures above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio.  this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses.the following is a summary of the credit risk grade definitions for all loan types:‚Äú1‚Äù - high quality-  these loans represent a credit extension of the highest quality.  the borrower's historic (at least five years) cash flows manifest extremely large and stable margins of coverage.  balance sheets are conservative, well capitalized, and liquid.  after considering debt service for proposed and existing debt, projected cash flows continue to be strong and provide ample coverage. the borrower typically reflects broad geographic and product diversification and has access to alternative financial markets.  ‚Äú2‚Äù - good quality-  these loans have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment.  the borrower may have access to alternative sources of financing, but sources are not as widely available as they are to a higher graded borrower.  this loan carries a normal level of risk, with minimal loss exposure.  the borrower has the ability to perform according to the terms of the credit facility. the margins of cash flow coverage are satisfactory but vulnerable to more rapid deterioration than the highest quality loans.  ‚Äú3‚Äù - satisfactory-  the borrowers are a reasonable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations.  risk factors may include reliability of margins and cash flows, liquidity, dependence on a single product or industry, cyclical trends, depth of management, or limited access to alternative financing sources.  historic financial information may indicate erratic performance, but current trends are positive.  quality of financial information is adequate, but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher graded loans.  if adverse circumstances arise, the impact on the borrower may be significant. ‚Äú4‚Äù - satisfactory - merits attention-  these credit facilities have potential developing weaknesses that deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel.  if the developing weakness is not corrected or mitigated, there may be deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the bank's debt in the future.  ‚Äú5‚Äù - watch  or special mention -   these loans are typically existing loans, made using the passing grades outlined above, that have deteriorated to the point that cash flow is not consistently adequate to meet debt service or current debt service coverage is based on projections.  secondary sources of repayment may include specialized collateral or real estate that is not readily marketable or undeveloped, making timely collection in doubt. ‚Äú6‚Äù - substandard-  loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade are considered inadequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral.  these obligations, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have well-defined weaknesses related to adverse financial, managerial, economic, market, or political conditions jeopardizing repayment of principal and interest as originally intended.  clear loss potential, however, does not have to exist in any individual assets classified as substandard.‚Äú7‚Äù - substandard impaired (also includes any loans over 90 days past due, excluding sold mortgages )-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú6,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 16table of contentsand values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  "7b"-  doubtful-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7b‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú7,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  such pending factors could include merger or liquidation, additional capital injection, refinancing plans, or perfection of liens on additional collateral.  loans in this classification are placed in non-accrual status, with collections applied to principal on the bank's books and evaluated for impairment.  all loans in this category are considered impaired and all material loans are evaluated for a specific reserve in accordance with asc 310-10 and the bank's alll methodology and specific reserve guidelines.‚Äú8‚Äù - loss-  loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of the bank.  such loans are to be charged-off or charged-down.  this classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but that it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.the following is a summary of credit quality indicators by class at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013:real estate credit exposure as of march 31, 2014commercial real

loans classified as nonaccrual, foreclosed bank-owned property and loans past due 90 days or more on which interest is still being accrued.  it is the general policy of the bank to stop accruing interest for all classes of loans past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  in addition, certain restructured loans are placed on nonaccrual status until sufficient evidence of timely payment is obtained.  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period.  amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  there were no financing receivables past due over 90 days accruing interest as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013. nonperforming loans as of march31, 2014 totaled $15.1 million, or 1.09% of total loans, compared with $15.4 million, or 1.12% of total loans, as of december31, 2013.  the bank aggressively pursues the collection and repayment of all loans. other nonperforming assets, such as repossessed and foreclosed collateral is aggressively liquidated by the bank's collection department.  the total number of loans on nonaccrual status has decreased from 195 at december31, 2013 to 187 at march31, 2014. yadkin

graded 7b) or ‚Äúloss‚Äù (loans graded 8) to be individually impaired and may consider ‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù loans (loans graded 6) individually impaired depending on the borrower's payment history.  the bank measures impairment based upon probable cash flows or the value of the collateral.  collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.   updated appraisals are required for all impaired loans and typically at renewal or modification of larger loans if the appraisal is more than 12 months old. impaired loans for all classes of loans typically include nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans and other potential problem loans considered impaired based on other underlying factors.  troubled debt restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition.  interest on troubled debt restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur and a sustained payment performance period is obtained.  due to the borrowers' inability to make the payments required under the original loan terms, the bank modifies the terms by granting a longer amortized repayment structure or reduced interest rates. potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above, but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms.  these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual, past due or troubled debt restructured loans, so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  impaired loans under $250,000 are collectively reviewed for impairment based on homogeneous pools established for each class of impaired loans with similar risk characteristics in accordance with asc 310-10-35-21 and are not included with non-impaired loans.  separate loss given probability of default rates are calculated for each impaired pool representing the risk associated with impaired loans less than $250,000 for that pool of loans.  total impaired loans under $250,000 collectively evaluated were $6.9 yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014

for purchased impaired loans.  impaired loans acquired with subsequent deterioration and related allowance for loan losses are loans in which additional impairment has been identified in excess of credit discounts resulting in additional reserves.  these additional reserves are included in the allowance for loan losses related to purchased impaired loans and were $2,580 and $3,567 as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  at march31, 2014, the outstanding balance of purchased impaired loans from american community bancshares, inc. ("american community"), which includes principal, interest and fees due, was $89,856.  because of the uncertainty of the expected cash flows, the company is accounting for each purchased impaired loan under the cost recovery method, in which all cash payments are applied to principal.  thus, there is no accretable yield associated with the above loans.  troubled debt restructured loans.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans outstanding as of march31, 2014 was $15.6 million with related reserves of $457,768.  approximately $12.2 million of troubled debt restructured loans are current and accruing interest as of march31, 2014, as these loans have sufficient evidence of paying according to the new restructured terms.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans outstanding as of december31, 2013 were $21.5 million with related reserves of $1.2 million.  approximately $15.3 million of troubled debt restructured loans were accruing interest as of december31,

restructured loans for the three months ended march31, 2014 and 2013.  the company reports the recorded investment in the loans prior to a modification and also the recorded investment in the loans

losses charged to expense, which represents management's best estimate for probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.  the primary risks inherent in the bank's loan portfolio, including the adequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses, are based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these risks, and the related loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by direct charges to provision expense. losses on loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible. recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance for loan losses. the provision for (recovery of) loan losses was $(460,000) for the quarter ended march31, 2014 as compared to $237,000 for the quarter ended march 31, 2013. the provision expense is determined by management  with the use of the bank's allowance for loan losses model. the components of the model are specific reserves for impaired loans and a general allocation for unimpaired loans.  the general allocation has two components, an estimate based on historical loss experience and an additional estimate based on internal and external environmental factors due to the uncertainty of historical loss experience in predicting current embedded losses in the portfolio that will be realized in the future.  the portion of the general allocation on environmental factors includes estimates of losses related to interest rate trends, unemployment trends, real estate characteristics, past due and nonaccrual trends, watch list trends, charge-off trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.   the real estate characteristics component includes trends in real estate concentrations, exceptions to federal deposit insurance company ("fdic") guidelines for loan-to-value ratios, and changes in real estate market values.  other factors impacting the allowance at march31, 2014 were watch list trends, unemployment rate trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.

family residential loan with a recorded investment of  $89,856. and $90,741, respectively, as of march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013; with related allowances of $2,580 and $3,567 as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the allowance model is applied to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for unimpaired loans grouped by loan type.  the company's loan charge-off policy for all loan classes is to charge down loans to net realizable value once a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable, and the underlying collateral shortfall is assessed.  unsecured loans (primarily consumer loans) are charged off against the reserve once the loan becomes 90 days past due or it is determined that a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  secured loans (primarily construction, real estate, commercial and other loans) are moved to nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable and supporting collateral is not considered to be sufficient to cover potential losses.  nonaccrual loans are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if all or a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  nonaccrual loans that are determined to be solely collateral dependent are promptly charged down to net realizable value upon determination that they are impaired.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 26table of contentsin addition to the allowance for loan losses, the company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments. unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by loan classification. these classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the reserve for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $110,339 and $116,309 as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  the company maintains reserves for mortgage loans sold to agencies and investors in the event that, either through error or disagreement between the parties, the company is required to indemnify the purchase. the reserves take into consideration risks associated with underwriting, key factors in the mortgage industry, loans with specific reserve requirements, past due loans and potential indemnification by the company. reserves are estimated based on consideration of factors in the mortgage industry such as declining collateral values and rising levels of delinquency, default and foreclosure, coupled with increased incidents of quality reviews at all levels of the mortgage industry seeking justification for pushing back losses to loan originators and wholesalers. as of march31, 2014, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $211,774, and charges against reserves for the three months ended march31, 2014 were $7,030.  charges against reserves for the three months ended march 31, 2013 were $83,198 .  for the three months ended march31, 2014, the company recorded $4,914 in recapture of provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $40 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  for the three months ended march31, 2013, the company recorded $(1.3) million in negative provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $78.7 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  reduction in provisions for the three months ended march 31, 2013 were the result of decreased mortgage activity, improvements in historical loss experience, and declines in specific reserves as claims were paid and settled from previously established reserves.   for the three ended march31, 2014 and 2013, the company did not repurchase any mortgage loans sold.  as of december31, 2013, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $216,687 related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure.11. fair valuethe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. available-for-sale securities, interest rate swaps, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and forward sale loan commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, from time to time, the company may be required to record other assets at fair value, such as loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments usually involve writing the asset down to fair value or the lower of cost or market value. following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. available-for-sale investment securitiesavailable-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, u.s. treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three months ended march31, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.interest rate swapsinterest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models run by a third-party on a monthly basis.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.   as a result, the company classifies interest rate swaps as level 3.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 27table of contentsthe following table

$178,000 and $39,000, respectively.  at december31, 2013, the amount of fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments and sale commitments was $(23,000) and $147,000, respectively.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the company classifies interest rate lock commitments as level 3.  the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end.  the company classified forward sale commitments as level 2.  there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three months ended march31, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.the following table presents a rollforward of interest rate lock commitments for the three months ended march31, 2014 and 2012,

evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings.  the present value of the future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool, calculated by a third party at least semi-annually, using assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing.   as such, the company classifies loan servicing

or market value. the fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. the changes in fair value of the assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.  as such, the company classifies loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a level 2 asset.  at march31, 2014, the cost of the company's mortgage loans held-for-sale was less than the market value.  accordingly, the company's loans held-for-sale are carried at cost. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three months ended march31, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.impaired loansthe company does not record loans held-for-investment at fair value on a recurring basis. however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs), market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. at march31, 2014, the majority of impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral by obtaining third-party appraisals and applying liquidity discounts.  third party appraisals are obtained at least annually for all impaired loans greater than $250,000.  the company records impaired loans as nonrecurring level 3. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three months ended march31, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.other real estate ownedother real estate owned (‚Äúoreo‚Äù) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to oreo. subsequently, oreo is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs). when the fair value of the collateral is measured due to further deterioration in the value of the oreo since initial recognition, the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level 3. the current carrying value of oreo at march31, 2014 is $2.8 million.  at december31, 2013 the carrying value of oreo was $3.3 million. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three months ended march31, 2014.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014

owned1,034discounted appraisalscollateral discounts15%the unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate swap agreements is the discount rate. a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. the discount rate is determined by the third-party by obtaining third party market quotes from reuters, which handle up to 30 year swap maturities.  the company's asset liability management team periodically reviews the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate lock commitments is the pull through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments to increase if in a gain position, or decrease if in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company's mortgage banking division.the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the company's mortgage servicing rights are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions.  the company utilizes an independent yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 31table of contentsthird-party to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through use of a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income based on observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at an estimated fair value. to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the fair value and constant prepayment rates are compared to forward-looking estimates by the company. the following table presents assets measured at fair value on a

fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices, prices quoted for similar instruments, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. for certain categories of loans, such as installment and commercial loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. the cost of fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale approximates the lower of cost or market as these loans are typically sold within 60 days of origination. fair values for adjustable-rate mortgages are based on quoted market prices of similar loans adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  the company applied an additional illiquidity discount in the amount of 5.0%.the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the fhlb stock.the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts is estimated using the present value of the projected cash flows using rates currently offered for similar deposits with similar maturities.the fair values of borrowings are based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate for debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.  due to limited markets, discount rates applied to junior subordinated debt are based on estimated cost to raise capital, which was 8% as of march31, 2014.  the carrying values of short-term borrowings, including overnight, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and fhlb advances, approximates the fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments.  the company's credit risk is not material to calculation of fair value because these borrowings are collateralized. the carrying values of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair values due to the short-term duration.interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 34table of contentsinterest rate locks and forward loan sale commitments are recorded at fair

was $20.3 million at march31, 2014 and $23.4 million at december 31, 2013.     in evaluating whether the company will realize the full benefit of its net deferred tax asset, it considers both positive and negative evidence, including recent earnings trends and projected earnings, asset quality, and other significant events.  a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. as of march 31, 2014, the company returned to a cumulative pretax income position excluding goodwill impairment for the 3-year period ending march31, 2014 of $1.7 million and the company is projecting income on a pretax basis, as well as taxable income, for the future periods 2014-2016. credit quality has also improved dramatically over the past two years, including significant decreases in classified loans and nonperforming loans. after review of all available evidence and based on the weight of such evidence, the company believes the realization of the deferred tax asset  is, more likely than not and no valuation allowance is deemed necessary at march31, 2014 based primarily on a return to profitability, pretax income trends, projected pretax income for the years 2014-2016 and improving credit quality metrics.march 31,

operations for the three months ended march31, 2014  and 2013 and also analyzes our financial condition as of march31, 2014 as compared to december31, 2013.  like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments.  our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.  consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.  another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.  we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings.  in the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.  we describe the various components of this noninterest income, as well as our noninterest expense, in the following discussion.the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements.  we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.the company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or occurrences after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.in 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and filed an amendment to both the company's and the bank's articles of incorporation changing their name to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to  share data have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.recent eventson january 27, 2014, the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the ‚Äúmerger agreement‚Äù) with vantagesouth bancshares, inc., a delaware corporation (‚Äúvantagesouth‚Äù), and piedmont community bank holdings, inc., a delaware corporation and majority stockholder of vantagesouth (‚Äúpiedmont‚Äù). the merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, vantagesouth and piedmont will merge with and into the company, with the company continuing yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 41table of contentsas the surviving corporation. the merger agreement also provides that, immediately following the effective time of the mergers, vantagesouth bank, a north carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of vantagesouth, will merge with and into the bank, with yadkin bank continuing as the surviving bank in the bank merger. the merger agreement was approved by each of the boards of directors of the company, vantagesouth, and piedmont.  see note 16 - vantagesouth bancshares, inc. and piedmont community bank holdings, inc. mergers for further discussion.changes in financial positiontotal assets at march31, 2014 were $1,813.5 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 0.4%, compared to assets of $1,806.0 million at december31, 2013.  the loan portfolio, net of allowance for losses, was $1,366.2 million compared to 1,340.7 million at december31, 2013.  gross loans held-for-investment increased by $24.0 million, or 1.8% as loan production has increased.  the allowance for loan losses decreased $1.5 million driven primarily by decreases in classified loans for the quarter ended march31, 2014 and decreased historic losses in 2014 as compared to 2013. total watch list and substandard loans were $77.6 million as compared to $84.4 million as of december31, 2013, a decrease of $6.8 million.   see note 10 above entitled ‚Äúloans and allowance for loan losses‚Äù for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses.mortgage loans held-for-sale decreased by $12.0 million, or 63.2%, from december31, 2013 to march31, 2014 as the bank continued its strategy of selling mortgage loans mostly to various investors with servicing rights released and to a lesser extent to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation with servicing rights retained.   these loans are normally held for a period of two to three weeks before being sold to investors.  mortgage loans closed in the first three months of 2014 ranged from a low of $9.3 million in february 2014 to a high of $12.3 million in january 2014 and totaled $32.8 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014.  mortgage loans closed during the three months ended march 31, 2013 totaled $69.5 million.   decrease in mortgage activity, including refinance activity, is the result of an increase in rates and volatility.the securities portfolio decreased from $288.9 million at december31, 2013, to $267.1 million at march31, 2014, a decrease of $21.8 million due to paydowns and maturities of $7.8 million and sales of $20.4 million in 2014, offset by purchases of 5.0 million.  the portfolio is comprised of securities of u.s. government agencies (6.1%), mortgage-backed securities (62.0%), state and municipal securities (30.8%), and publicly traded common and preferred stocks (1.2%).  other assets increased slightly by $92,000 or 0.88% from december 31, 2013.  oreo decreased $439,000 as the result of sales in the amount of $517,000 and $117,000 in writedowns, offset by transfers in the amount of $196,000 for the three months ended march31, 2014.  premises and equipment decreased $302,000, or 0.74% due to depreciation of $670,000 offset by additions of $367,000.  deferred tax assets also decreased $3.1 million as the company recorded $6.6 million in income before taxes for the year 2014, utilizing net operating loss carryforwards.  see note 14 for detailed information regarding deferred tax assets.deposits increased $7.1 million, or 0.5%, comparing march31, 2014 to december31, 2013. overall, noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $20.0 million, or 7.5%, and now, savings, and money market accounts increased $11.0 million, or 1.6%.  certificates of deposit (‚Äúcods‚Äù) over $100,000 decreased $9.6 million, or 4.2%, and other cods decreased $14.3 million, or 4.3%.   management continues to focus on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand and now accounts through the use of marketing efforts and interest rates.borrowed funds increased $825,000, or 0.9%, comparing march31, 2014 to december31, 2013 due to an $823,000 increase in repurchase agreements. long term borrowings included $35.0 million in trust preferred securities and advances from the fhlb of $25.3 million.  the american community merger added $10.4 million in trust preferred securities in 2007 at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.80% and will mature in 2033.  yadkin valley statutory trust i (‚Äúthe trust‚Äù) issued $25.8 million in trust preferred securities in 2007 at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 1.32%. the trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, and can be called by the trust without penalty. other liabilities, capital lease obligations and accrued interest payable combined decreased by $4.7 million, or 33.9%, from december31, 2013 to march31, 2014.  decreases in other liabilities resulted primarily from a $2.5 million decrease in accrued incentive expense as 2013 accruals were paid out in the first quarter of 2014.  at december 31, 2013 other liabilities also included a $1.7 million payable for a security purchase which was settled in january 2014. at march31, 2014, total shareholders' equity was $188.8 million, or a book value of $11.15 per common share, compared to $184.5 million, or a book value of $10.85 per common share, at december31, 2013.  the company's equity to assets ratio was 10.41% and 10.21%, at march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 42table of contentscapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  in order to be considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù, a bank must exceed total risk-based capital ratios of 10%, and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6% and leverage ratios of 5%.  our goal has been to maintain a ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù status for the bank since failure to meet or exceed this classification affects how regulatory applications for certain activities, including acquisitions, and continuation and expansion of existing activities, are evaluated and could make our customers and potential investors less confident in our bank. the following table sets forth the company's and the bank's various capital ratios as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013.  the company and the bank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios as of march31, 2014, as well as the ratios to be considered "well capitalized."  march 31,

ratio11.9%11.7%11.5%11.2%management of equity is a critical aspect of capital management in any business.  the determination of the appropriate amount of equity for a regulated financial institution is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the amount of capital needed to meet regulatory requirements, the amount of ‚Äúrisk equity‚Äù the business requires and balance sheet leverage.in july 2013, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the ‚Äúfederal reserve‚Äù) and the fdic approved final rules to implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, among other changes required by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. the rules will apply to all national and state banks, such as the company, which we collectively refer to herein as covered banking organizations.  bank holding companies with less than $500 million in total consolidated assets are not subject to the final rule, nor are savings and loan holding companies substantially engaged in commercial activities or insurance underwriting.  the framework requires covered banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, taking into account the impact of risk. the approved rules include a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as well as a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. the rules also raise the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all covered banking institutions.  in terms of quality of capital, the final rules emphasize common equity tier 1 capital and implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. the rules also change the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. the changes begin to take effect for the company and the bank in january 2015.  the ultimate impact of the new capital standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed.  liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market riskthe bank derives the majority of its liquidity from its core deposit base and to a lesser extent from wholesale borrowing.  the balance sheet liquidity ratio, measured by the sum of cash (less reserve requirements), investments, and loans held-for-sale reduced by pledged securities, as compared to deposits and short-term borrowings, was 14.6% at march31, 2014 compared to 15.4% at december 31, 2013.  additional liquidity is provided by $147.8 million in unused credit including federal funds purchased lines provided by correspondent banks as well as credit availability from the fhlb. in addition, the bank has unpledged marketable securities of $160.5 million available for use as a source of collateral.  at march31, 2014, brokered deposits totaled $35.0 million, or 2.29% of total deposits.  brokered certificates of deposit are primarily short-term with maturities of nine months or less.  the bank also maintains a brokered deposit now account to add municipal deposits totaling $1,299 at march31, 2014.  the bank contracted with promontory interfinancial network ("promontory") in 2008 for various services including wholesale cod funding. promontory's cdars¬Æ product, one-way buysm, enables the bank to bid on a weekly basis through a private auction for cod terms ranging from four weeks to 260weeks (approximately five years) with settlement available each thursday.  there were no outstanding funds acquired through the one-way buy product at march31, 2014 or december 31, 2013. promontory also provides a product, cdars¬Æ reciprocal, which allows the bank's customers to place funds in excess of the fdic insurance limit with promontory's network of participating banks so that the customer is fully insured for the amount deposited. promontory provides reciprocating funds to the bank from funds placed at other banks by their customers. the bank yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 43table of contentssets its customers' interest rates when they place deposits through the network and pays/receives the rate difference to/from the other banks whose reciprocal funds are held by the bank. the overall impact of this process is that the bank effectively pays the rate offered to its relationship customer. therefore, the bank does not consider these funds to be wholesale or brokered funds. in compliance with fdic reporting requirements, the bank includes reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits in its quarterly federal financial institutions examination council call report.  cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits totaled $165,000 at december 31, 2013.  there were no cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits outstanding at march 31, 2014.management continues to assess interest rate risk internally and by utilizing outside sources.  the balance sheet is asset sensitive over a three-month period, meaning that there will be more assets than liabilities immediately repricing as market rates change. over a period of twelve months, the balance sheet remains slightly asset sensitive. we generally would benefit from increasing market interest rates when we have an asset-sensitive, or a positive interest rate gap, and we would generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we have liability-sensitive, or a negative interest rate gap.  the company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.  the company's exposure to market risk is reviewed regularly by management.results of operationsnet income for the quarter ended march31, 2014 was $3.9 million before preferred dividends, compared to net income of $4.6 million in the same period of 2013.  net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended march31, 2014 was $3.3 million.   net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended march31, 2013 was $4.2 million.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.24 and $0.23, respectively, for the three month period ended march31, 2014.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.30 for the three month period ended march31, 2013.  on an annualized basis, first quarter results represent a return on average assets of 0.76% at march31, 2014 compared to 0.91% at march31, 2013, and a return on average equity of 7.29% compared to 9.94% at march31, 2013.   net interest incomenet interest income, the largest contributor to earnings, increased $1.6 million, or 10.3%, to $16.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared with $15.1 million in the same period of 2013.  the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 40.1% as average interest bearing deposits are down 7% from the prior year and deposit costs are declining as time deposits continue to reprice at lower rates.   the net interest margin increased to 4.11% in the first quarter of 2014 from 3.57% in the first quarter of 2013.    the increase in net interest margin is primarily related to a decrease in deposit yields and borrowings cost as well as an increase in yields on securities.  deposit yields have decreased as management focused efforts on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing now and money market accounts.  the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of changing rates on net interest income.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly

allowance for loan lossesadequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses of the bank is a significant estimate that is based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 45table of contentsthe allowance for loan losses was $16.5 million at march31, 2014, or 1.19% of loans held-for-investment, as compared to $18.1 million, or 1.33% of loans held-for-investment, at december31, 2013.  decreases in the allowance for loan losses were due to decreased historical loss rates and decreased criticized loans in the first three months of 2014.  in addition, first quarter loan growth has been concentrated in loan portfolio types with lower historical losses including commercial real estate and secured one-to-four family residential mortgages, while higher risk portfolios (with high historical losses) have been decreasing thus leading to decreased reserves levels for the overall portfolio.  the allowance model is applied to the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for performing loans grouped by loan type.  out of the $16.5 million in total allowance for loan losses at march31, 2014, the specific allowance for impaired loans accounted for $690,000, up from $557,000 at year end.  see discussion below in "nonperforming assets" for further discussion of nonaccrual relationships.  the remaining general allowance, $15.8 million, was attributed to performing loans and was down from $17.5 million at year end.  the general allowance, as a percent of loans not individually reviewed for impairment was 1.16% as of march31, 2014 as compared to 1.31% as of december31, 2013.  the decrease in the general allowance was driven primarily by a decrease in historical loss rates, as well as a decrease in substandard and watch loans of $6.8 million which resulted from a few significant payoffs and improvements in past dues and underlying credit exposures of previously classified loans.  net loan charge offs were $1.1 million, or 0.32% (annualized), of average loans, for the three months ended march31, 2014 compared to $894,000, or 0.27% (annualized), of average loans for the three months ended march 31, 2013.  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the bank's loan portfolio as of march31, 2014. no assurance can be given in this regard, however, especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in the bank's market areas. management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and will consider future changes to the allowance that may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions.  additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the bank's allowance for loan losses.  such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses. the downturn experienced in the real estate market from 2008 through 2011 resulted in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures.  in some cases, that downturn resulted in significant impairments to the value of collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.  management aggressively monitors its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with significant weaknesses.  the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. if real estate values begin to decline in the future, it is more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and our net charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. assurances cannot be made either (1) that further charges to the allowance account will not be significant in relation to the normal activity or (2) that further evaluation of the loan portfolio based on prevailing conditions may not require sizable additions to the allowance and charges to provision expense. our real estate portfolio has approximately $124.9 million of construction loans, $592.9 million of commercial real estate loans, $180.1 million in first lien mortgage loans, $192.8 million in home equity lines of credit and $62.3 million in multifamily mortgage loans as of march31, 2014. we consider our construction and junior lien mortgage loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio.  construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed into properties such as sub-divisions or speculative houses. normally, these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the developed property.  in addition, management continues to evaluate closely junior lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.  given the slow economic recovery, and real estate values that have been slow to recover, the company recognizes that it may experience some loss in these portfolios, and management continues to monitor borrower financials,  ltvs, and first lien positions.   the significance of both construction and commercial real estate loans to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due.   loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  net charge-offs of construction and commercial real estate loans were $166,000 and $206,000, respectively, for the three months ended march31, 2014.  for the three months ended march31, 2013, net charge-offs  of construction and commercial real estate loans were $130,000 and $185,000, respectively.   as of march31, 2014, $7.4 million of our real estate loans had interest reserves including both borrower and bank funded, compared to $7.7 million as of december31, 2013.  there is a risk that an interest reserve could mask problems with a borrower's willingness yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 46table of contentsand ability to repay the debt consistent with the terms and conditions of the loan obligation, therefore the company has implemented review policies and internal controls to identify and monitor all loans with interest reserves.  nonperforming assetstotal nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due but still accruing, and foreclosed real estate) decreased from $18.7 million at december31, 2013 to $17.9 million at march31, 2014.  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 0.99% as of march31, 2014 as compared to 1.03% as of december31, 2013, due primarily to a decrease in foreclosed real estate and nonperforming loans since december31, 2013.  total nonaccrual loans decreased from $15.4 million, or 1.12% of total loans, at december 31, 2013 to $15.1 million, or 1.09% of total loans, at march31, 2014.  we have analyzed our nonperforming loans to determine what we believe is the amount needed to reserve in the allowance for loan losses based on an assessment of the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan.   we have downgraded loans for which the probability of collection is uncertain and written down oreo property values where net realizable values have declined.  specific allowance for nonperforming loans accounted for $690,000, up from $557,000 at year end, due to an increase in reserves on one relationship.  overall, loans individually reviewed for impairment have decreased $4.1 million since december 31, 2013.approximately 43% of loans in nonaccrual status are currently not past due 30 days or more. the total number of loans on nonaccrual has decreased from 195 to 187 since december 31, 2013. the average nonaccrual loan balance is $81,000 and $79,000 as of march31, 2014 and december31, 2013, respectively. at march31, 2014, 90% of the nonaccrual loans were secured by real estate.the largest nonaccrual relationship totaled $2.2 million as of march 31, 2014 and consists of two loans. one loan was originally used to refinance an owner-occupied commercial office building and the other loan was a discretionary line of credit used for investments and other expenses. the line of credit was secured by three residential lots and was charged down to fair market value during the first quarter of 2014. the first loan is secured by a commercial office building and does not have a specific reserve assigned to it as of march 31, 2014.  nonaccrual loans also included one other large relationship totaling $1.0 million as of march 31, 2014. this relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase and refinance of real estate, lease debt and related operating expenses, and secured by the real estate. there are no reserves assigned to these loans as of march 31, 2014. all of these loans have been placed in nonaccrual status because of concerns for the customers' continued ability to pay, collateral deterioration and the future industry outlook.noninterest incomenoninterest income consists of all revenues that are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets.  total noninterest income decreased approximately $960,000, or 17.0%, comparing the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 as mortgage banking income decreased $972,000, or 48.9% which resulted from decreased mortgage activity.   other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $45,000, or 3.5%, due primarily to a $120,000 decrease in nsf (non-sufficient funds) and odp (overdraft privilege charges).  these decreases were offset by an increase in service charges on now and money market accounts, business checking accounts, and regular checking accounts of $72,000 as checking and savings accounts have increased $78 million since march 31, 2013.  ‚Ä¢other service fees increased $98,000 when comparing the first quarter of 2013 to 2014 due to an increase of $127,000 in  atm and debit card fee income as incentive fees related to the signing of a new contract in 2012 are earned over the life of the contract.  offsetting this increase was a slight decrease in annuity and mutual fund commissions of $20,000.‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities increased $1.1 million as $20 million in investments were sold in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $1.1 million in 2013.‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by $16,000, or 10.5%, during the three month period ended march31, 2014.‚Ä¢mortgage banking income decreased $972,000 for the first quarter of 2014 as the overall gain on sale of loans decreased due primarily to a slowdown in the velocity of rate increases during the quarter, which impacts our mortgage income.   provisions for (recovery of) sold mortgage loans  also decreased $1.3 million due to a recovery of provision recorded for the first quarter of 2013 as dissolution of sidus and mortgage activity decreased significantly.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 47table of contents‚Ä¢other income increased by approximately $106,000, or 192.7%, for the first quarter of 2014.  this increase is primarily due to the receipt of a settlement of outstanding issue from prior years.noninterest expensetotal noninterest expenses were $15.2 million for the first quarter of 2014, compared to $13.2 million in the same period of 2013, an increase of $2.0 million, or 15.0% due to merger expenses in the amount of $1.4 million recorded during the first quarter.   noninterest expense also includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and all other operating costs.  noninterest expense to average assets for the quarter ended march31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.85%, and 0.70%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the three months ended march31, 2014 and 2013 were 66.14% and 66.39%, respectively.    the efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expenses less amortization of intangibles and gains on sale of other real estate owned to the total of the taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income.  the following is a summary of the fluctuations for the three months ended march31, 2014 as compared to march31, 2013:‚Ä¢quarter-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $528,000, or 7.1%.  the major components of this increase are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased $234,000 due to annual increases and addition of new employees.  payroll taxes also increased $230,000 due to the increase in salaries as well as payment of additional taxes due to incentive payments made in the first quarter.  other increases include employee group insurance expense which increased $135,000 and an increase of $59,000 in commissions.  offsetting these increases was a $123,000 decrease in incentive compensation.‚Ä¢occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by $69,000, or 3.8%, for the quarter due to a decrease in software and equipment maintenance costs as the first quarter of the prior year included additional costs in these areas.  ‚Ä¢advertising and marketing expense decreased by $51,000, or 19.9%, comparing the first quarter 2014 with the first quarter 2013.  the decreases are due to the fact that the prior year included costs associated with  the rebranding project announced in early 2013, including a company and bank name change.‚Ä¢data processing expense decreased $120,000, or 30.4%, for the quarter due to the implementation of live branch capture in 2013 which reduced daily courier service costs and provides additional efficiencies.  ‚Ä¢communication expense increased $48,000, or 14.5%, for the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013.   ‚Ä¢fdic assessment expenses decreased $441,000 for the quarter due primarily to a decrease in assessment rates.  in addition, deposits have decreased 10% since the first quarter of 2013.   ‚Ä¢net cost of operation of other real estate owned increased $1.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2013.  the company recorded gains on sales of $1.1 million for the three months ended march 31, 2013 as compared to losses resulting from writedowns in the amount of $117,000 recorded in the first quarter of 2014.‚Ä¢loan collection fees decreased $120,000, or 55.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2013 as past due and nonperforming loans have decreased since 2013.‚Ä¢other professional fees decreased $132,000 for the quarter when compared to the prior year due to timing and fees related to internal audit and external credit reviews were lower in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to 2013, due to additional external credit work performed in the prior year.‚Ä¢quarter-to-date other operating expenses decreased by $127,000, or 5.3%.     decreases include a $144,000 decrease in other expenses as the first quarter of 2013 included additional expenses accrued for the corporate rebranding and name change in the amount of $136,000.  in addition, the first quarter of 2013 included approximately $97,000 in third party fees were incurred related to recent projects including the capital raise, loan sale and oreo auction. ‚Ä¢expenses for the first quarter of 2014 also include $1.3 million in expenses related to the recently announced merger.    merger expenses include primarily attorney and other third party professional fees.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2014 48table of contentsincome tax expensethe company recorded income tax expense for the three months ended march31, 2014 and 2013 of $2.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively.      the effective tax rate for the three months ended march31, 2014 was 40.5%  as compared to 35.9% for the three months ended march31, 2013.   increase in the effective tax rate is due to certain merger expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2014 that are not deductible for tax purposes.  see footnote 14 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense and deferred tax assets.  item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskmarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending, deposit, and borrowing activities.  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  in addition to other risks that we manage in the normal course of business, such as credit quality and liquidity, management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could potentially have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  the information contained in item 2 in the section captioned "liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market risk" is incorporated herein by reference.  other types of market risks, such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities.  the acquisition of american community and expansion into new market areas in north and south carolina have marketing risks that are mitigated by retaining the american community brand name in these markets.  credit risk associated with loans acquired in the merger are part of the overall discussion of credit risk in the sections captioned ‚Äúprovision and allowance for loan losses‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-performing assets.‚Äùthe primary objective of asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk and achieve reasonable stability in net interest income throughout interest rate cycles.  this is achieved by maintaining the proper balance of rate-sensitive earning assets and rate-sensitive interest-bearing liabilities.  the relationship of rate-sensitive earning assets to rate-sensitive interest-bearing liabilities is the principal factor in projecting the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on future net interest income.  rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period. management monitors the rate sensitivity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over the entire life of these instruments, but places particular emphasis on the next twelve months.  following a period of rate increases (or decreases) net interest income will increase (or decrease) over both a three-month and a twelve-month period.item 4.  controls and proceduresas of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective (1)to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the securities exchange act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and (2)to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.changes in internal control over financial reportingthere were no changes in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. the company reviews its disclosure controls and procedures, which may include its internal control over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the company's systems evolve with its business.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report

policiesbasis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation  (the "company") and its subsidiary, yadkin bank (the "bank").  the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial statements and with instructions to form 10-q and regulation s-x.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for complete financial statements.  because the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included with the company's 2012 annual report on form 10-k (the "2012 form 10-k") filed with the securities and exchange commission (‚Äúsec‚Äù) on february 28, 2013.  operating results, for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013, do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the year or other interim periods.in the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments, all of which are normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of september30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013 and 2012.  the accounting policies followed are set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the company's 2012 form 10-k.reclassifications - certain expenses reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.  reclassifications include certain loan collection and occupancy expenses that were previously recorded in other expenses that have now been reclassified to loan collection fees and occupancy expense.  effective may 28, 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split.   all outstanding options and restricted shares  and earnings per share calculations have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.  for additional information related to the reverse stock split, see note 16, other events.the reclassifications above had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.2. new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardsin february 2013, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2013-02, "reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income" ("asu 2013-02"). this guidance is the culmination of the fasb's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci").  the amendments in asu 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. however, the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2012.  the company has adopted the standard and the adoption of asu 2013-02 did not have an impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows but did result in additional disclosures in footnote 15.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 7table of contents3.   stock-based compensationduring the three and nine months ended september30, 2013, 333  and 2,135

losses and fair value of investment securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012. securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at september30, 2013 include  one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and one collateralized mortgage obligation.  the key factors considered in evaluating the collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, and municipal securities were cash flows of the investment and the assessment of other relative economic factors, such as credit risk.  securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at december31, 2012 include three collateralized mortgage obligations, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and two other securities.   the unrealized losses relate to securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to a shift in demand from non-governmental securities and municipals to u.s. treasury bonds and governmental agencies due to market concerns. the unrealized losses are not likely to reverse unless market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. none of the unrealized losses relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer's ability to honor redemption obligations.  it is not more likely than not that the company will have to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013, there were no securities available-for-sale deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (‚Äúotti‚Äù).   if management determines that an investment has experienced an other

december31, 2012.  cost method investments at september30, 2013 include $5,273,000 in federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock and $679,123 of investments in various trust and financial companies, which are included in other assets.  all cost method investments were evaluated for impairment at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012.  the following factors have been considered in determining the carrying amount of fhlb stock: 1) the recoverability of the par value, 2) the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all operational needs in the foreseeable future and would not need to dispose of the stock below recorded amounts, 3) redemptions and purchases of the stock are at the discretion of the fhlb, 4) the company believes the fhlb has the ability to absorb economic losses given the expectation that the various fhlbs' have a high degree of government support, and 5) the unrealized losses related to securities owned by the fhlb are manageable given the capital levels of the organization.   during the nine months ended september30, 2013, the company's investment in a financial services company was considered to be other than temporarily impaired and approximately $39,185 was charged-off.   the remaining value of the investment after the charge-off was $62,815 at september30, 2013.  there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three months ended september30, 2013.   there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012.  6.  commitments and contingenciesin the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  at september30, 2013, the company had commitments outstanding of $307.2 million  for additional loan amounts.  commitments of the bank's mortgage lending department are excluded from this amount and discussed in the paragraph below.  additional commitments totaling $4.7 million were outstanding under standby letters of credit.  management does not expect any significant losses to result from these commitments. at september30, 2013, the bank had $25.5 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $38.0 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  see note 9 for additional disclosures on these derivative financial instruments.7.    earnings per common sharebasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting periods.  diluted net income available to common shareholders per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  the numerators of the basic net income per common share computations are the same as the numerators of the diluted net income per common share computations for all the periods presented.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013 excludes 178,281 shares of unvested restricted stock.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012 excludes 199,279 shares of unvested restricted stock.  a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computations to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computations is as follows:three months endednine months endedseptember 30,september 30,2013201220132012basic eps denominator:weighted average

months ended september30, 2013, there were 48,452 and 52,950 warrants and stock options, respectively, that were not considered dilutive because the exercise prices exceeded the average market price per share.  the non-dilutive options had exercise prices ranging from $20.37 to $57.21 per share for the three months ended september 30, 2013 and exercise prices ranging from $11.52 to $57.21 per share for the nine months ended september 30, 2013.  during the quarter and nine months ended september 30, 2013, 136,259 and  173,414 shares of restricted stock, respectively, were not considered dilutive because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method or yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 12table of contentsbecause performance and service criteria had not been met.  during the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, there were 82,322 warrants and stock options that were not considered dilutive. effective may 28, 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split.   all references to net income per share and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.  for additional information related to the reverse stock split, see note 16, other events.8.   shareholders' equityeffective october 1, 2012, north carolina passed the banking modernization act, pursuant to section 53c-4-7 of which, the bank, as a north carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends if such distributions will not reduce its capital below its applicable ‚Äúrequired capital.‚Äù the bank's ‚Äúrequired capital‚Äù is that amount of capital required for the bank to be deemed ‚Äúadequately capitalized‚Äù under applicable federal regulatory capital ratios.  currently, the bank exceeds each of these federal regulatory capital ratios. however, the bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends to the holding company without prior approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation (the ‚Äúfdic‚Äù) and the north carolina banking commissioner. in addition, the company has committed to the regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.0%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% to be classified as well-capitalized.   the bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is 10.9% at september30, 2013 and exceeds committed levels.as further explained in note 16, other events, during the second quarter of 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and amendments to the company's and the bank's articles of incorporation changing their names to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to net income per share and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.9.  derivativesthe company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.for derivatives that are economic hedges, but are not designated as hedging instruments or otherwise do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income during the period of change.as part of interest rate risk management, the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed-rate receivables to floating rates and certain fixed-rate obligations to floating rates.the interest rate swaps are used to provide fixed rate financing while managing interest rate risk and were not designated as hedges.  the interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month libor, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. the interest rate swaps are settled quarterly and mature on june 15, 2016.   the interest rate swaps each had a notional amount of $1.9 million at september30, 2013, representing the amount of fixed-rate receivables outstanding and liabilities outstanding, and are included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair value of $145,930.   the company had a gain of $8,138 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $8,138 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended september30, 2013.  the company had a gain of $50,077 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $50,077 on the interest rate swap liability for the nine months ended september30, 2013.   the company had a gain of $334 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $334 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended september30, 2012.  the company had a gain of $4,057 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $4,057 on the interest rate swap liability for the nine months ended september30, 2012. the interest rate swaps had a notional amount of $2.0 million outstanding as of december31, 2012 and was included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair market value of $196,006.  all changes in fair value are recorded as other income within non-interest income.  fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts.the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing mortgage origination business. the bank's mortgage banking segment enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.  the primary risks managed by derivative instruments are these interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments.  interest rate lock commitments are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed rate loan commitments.  the period of time between the issuance of a loan commitment and the closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 10 to 60days. such interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments represent derivative instruments which are required to be carried at fair value. these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of the company's interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 13table of contentswhen the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the balance sheet in other assets and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.  the fair value of the company's forward sales commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.at september30, 2013, the bank had $25.5 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $38.0 million of forward commitments outstanding for original commitments and outstanding mortgage loans held-for-sale under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other liabilities was $259,855 at september30, 2013.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other assets was $483,935 at september30, 2013.  recognition of losses and gains related to the change in fair value of forward sales commitments were $(871,940) and $220,951 for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013, respectively, and are included in mortgage banking activities income. recognition of  gains and losses related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments were $796,052 and $(388,909) for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013, respectively, and are included in mortgage banking activities income.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $64,294 and $41,610 for the three months ended september30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other income.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $141,071 and $330,279 for the nine months ended september30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other income. at december31, 2012, the bank had $46.7 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $71.5 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other liabilities was $480,806 at december31, 2012.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other assets was $872,844 at december31, 2012.10. loans and allowance for loan lossesgeneral.  the bank provides to its customers a full range of short- to medium-term commercial, agricultural, small business administration guaranteed, mortgage, home equity, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans.  the following table presents loans at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012 by class:june 30,december 31,20132012(in

residential mortgages, and home equity lines of credit.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 14table of contentscommercial real estate loans totaled $575.5 million and $554.5 million at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  this lending has involved loans secured by owner-occupied commercial buildings for office, storage and warehouse space, as well as non-owner occupied commercial buildings. the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt.  loans secured by commercial real estate may be larger in size and may involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties.construction/development lending totaled $129.0 million and $132.0 million at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the bank originates one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower) and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre-sold homes.  the bank generally receives a pre-arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre-sold homes; however, the bank also engages in selected speculative housing lending to existing builder clients utilizing lots that the bank has a collateral interest in.  the bank also makes commercial real estate construction loans, primarily for owner-occupied properties.  the bank limits its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures.  residential one-to-four family loans amounted to $171.7 million and $168.6 million at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively. the bank's residential mortgage loans are typically construction loans that convert into permanent financing and are secured by properties located within the bank's market areas.  home equity lines of credit totaled $193.3 million and $191.9 million at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the bank's home equity lines of credit generally are variable rate lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties with interest only payment options during a draw period.  at the end of the draw period, the line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment with repayment terms of up to 30 years.  commercial loans.  at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, the bank's commercial loan portfolio totaled $171.0 million and $174.4 million, respectively. commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital, expansion, and other business purposes.  short-term working capital loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate.  lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength, cash flow, management and credit history of the borrower, and the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  with few exceptions, the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment.  commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans.  consumer loans.  loans to individuals (consumer loans) include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans.  consumer loans totaled $51.4 million and $51.7 million at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans, even if secured, if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, and equipment.  repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan.  consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss, illness and other personal factors.  the bank manages the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss.loan approvals.  the bank's loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations.  the guidelines address the type of loans that the bank seeks, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations.  all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  these limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness to the bank, including any indebtedness as a guarantor. the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the bank.  the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by independent, outside professionals experienced in loan review.  responsibility for loan review, loan underwriting, and approval resides with the chief credit officer position. on an annual basis, the board of directors of the bank determines officers lending authority.  authorities may include loans, letters of credit, overdrafts, uncollected funds and such other authorities as determined by the board of directors.substantially all of the company's loans have been granted to customers in the piedmont, foothills, northwestern mountains, and the research triangle regions of north carolina and the upstate region of south carolina.credit review and evaluation.  the bank has a credit review department that reports to the chief credit officer.  the focus of the department is on policy compliance and proper grading of higher credit risk loans as well as new and existing loans on a sample yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 15table of contentsbasis. additional reporting for problem/criticized assets has been developed along with an after-the-fact loan review.  a newly expanded enterprise risk management role also performs ongoing credit review and  evaluation  to help manage and assess overall credit risk for the company.the bank uses a risk grading program to facilitate the evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for real estate, commercial and consumer loans.  in this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers, reviewed by regional credit officers, and further reviewed by internal credit review analysts on a test basis.  the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank's market area.  every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies.  loans over $20,000 are risk graded on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 8 (loss).  acceptable loans at inception are grades 1 through 4, and these grades have underwriting requirements that at least meet the minimum requirements of a secondary market source.  if borrowers do not meet credit history requirements, other mitigating criteria such as substantial liquidity and low loan-to-value ratios could be considered and would generally have to be met in order to make the loan.  the bank's loan policy states that a guarantor may be necessary if reasonable doubt exists as to the borrower's ability to repay.  the board of directors has authorized the loan officers to have individual approval authority for risk grade 1 through 4 loans up to maximum exposure limits for each customer.  new or renewed loans that are graded 5 (special mention) or lower must have approval from a regional credit officer. any changes in risk assessments as determined by loan officers, credit administrators, regulatory examiners and management are also considered.  the risk grades, normally assigned by the loan officers when the loan is originated and reviewed by the regional credit officers, are based on several factors including historical data, current economic factors, composition of the portfolio, and evaluations of the total loan portfolio and assessments of credit quality within specific loan types.  in some cases, the risk grades are assigned by regional executives, depending upon dollar exposure.  because these factors are dynamic, the provision for loan losses can fluctuate.  credit quality reviews are based primarily on analysis of borrowers' cash flows, with asset values considered only as a second source of payment.   regional credit officers work with lenders in underwriting, structuring and risk grading the bank's credits.  the risk review officer focuses on lending policy compliance, credit risk grading, and credit risk reviews on larger dollar exposures.  management uses the information developed from the procedures above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio.  this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses.the following is a summary of the credit risk grade definitions for all loan types:‚Äú1‚Äù - high quality-  these loans represent a credit extension of the highest quality.  the borrower's historic (at least five years) cash flows manifest extremely large and stable margins of coverage.  balance sheets are conservative, well capitalized, and liquid.  after considering debt service for proposed and existing debt, projected cash flows continue to be strong and provide ample coverage. the borrower typically reflects broad geographic and product diversification and has access to alternative financial markets.  ‚Äú2‚Äù - good quality-  these loans have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment.  the borrower may have access to alternative sources of financing, but sources are not as widely available as they are to a higher graded borrower.  this loan carries a normal level of risk, with minimal loss exposure.  the borrower has the ability to perform according to the terms of the credit facility. the margins of cash flow coverage are satisfactory but vulnerable to more rapid deterioration than the highest quality loans.  ‚Äú3‚Äù - satisfactory-  the borrowers are a reasonable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations.  risk factors may include reliability of margins and cash flows, liquidity, dependence on a single product or industry, cyclical trends, depth of management, or limited access to alternative financing sources.  historic financial information may indicate erratic performance, but current trends are positive.  quality of financial information is adequate, but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher graded loans.  if adverse circumstances arise, the impact on the borrower may be significant. ‚Äú4‚Äù - satisfactory - merits attention-  these credit facilities have potential developing weaknesses that deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel.  if the developing weakness is not corrected or mitigated, there may be deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the bank's debt in the future.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 16table of contents‚Äú5‚Äù - watch  or special mention -   these loans are typically existing loans, made using the passing grades outlined above, that have deteriorated to the point that cash flow is not consistently adequate to meet debt service or current debt service coverage is based on projections.  secondary sources of repayment may include specialized collateral or real estate that is not readily marketable or undeveloped, making timely collection in doubt. ‚Äú6‚Äù - substandard-  loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade are considered inadequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral.  these obligations, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have well-defined weaknesses related to adverse financial, managerial, economic, market, or political conditions jeopardizing repayment of principal and interest as originally intended.  clear loss potential, however, does not have to exist in any individual assets classified as substandard.‚Äú7‚Äù - substandard impaired (also includes any loans over 90 days past due, excluding sold mortgages )-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú6,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  "7b"-  doubtful-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7b‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú7,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  such pending factors could include merger or liquidation, additional capital injection, refinancing plans, or perfection of liens on additional collateral.  loans in this classification are placed in non-accrual status, with collections applied to principal on the bank's books and evaluated for impairment.  all loans in this category are considered impaired and all material loans are evaluated for a specific reserve in accordance with asc 310-10 and the bank's alll methodology and specific reserve guidelines.‚Äú8‚Äù - loss-  loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of the bank.  such loans are to be charged-off or charged-down.  this classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but that it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.the following is a summary of credit quality indicators by class at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012:real estate credit exposure as of september 30, 2013commercial real

which interest is still being accrued.  it is the general policy of the bank to stop accruing interest for all classes of loans past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  in addition, certain restructured loans are placed on nonaccrual status until sufficient evidence of timely payment is obtained.  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period.  amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  there were no financing receivables past due over 90 days accruing interest as of september30, 2013 and december31, 2012. nonperforming loans as of september30, 2013 totaled $17.9 million, or 1.33% of total loans, compared with $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, as of december31, 2012.  the bank aggressively pursues the collection and repayment of all loans. other nonperforming assets, such as repossessed and foreclosed collateral is aggressively liquidated by the bank's collection department.  the total number of loans on nonaccrual status has decreased from 315 at december31, 2012 to 203 at september30, 2013. the following is a breakdown of nonaccrual loans as of september30, 2013 and december31,

(loans graded 7b) or ‚Äúloss‚Äù (loans graded 8) to be individually impaired and may consider ‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù loans (loans graded 6) individually impaired depending on the borrower's payment history.  the bank measures impairment based upon probable cash flows or the value of the collateral.  collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.   updated appraisals are required for all impaired loans and typically at renewal or modification of larger loans if the appraisal is more than 12 months old. impaired loans for all classes of loans typically include nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans and other potential problem loans considered impaired based on other underlying factors.  troubled debt restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition.  interest on troubled debt restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur and a sustained payment performance period is obtained.  due to the borrowers' inability to make the payments required under the original loan terms, the bank modifies the terms by granting a longer amortized repayment structure or reduced interest rates. potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above, but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms.  these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual, past due or troubled debt restructured loans, so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  impaired loans under $250,000 are collectively reviewed for impairment based on homogeneous pools established for each class of impaired loans with similar risk

without a related allowance for loan losses includes loans for which no additional reserves have been recorded in excess of credit discounts for purchased impaired loans.  impaired loans acquired with subsequent deterioration and related allowance for loan losses are loans in which additional impairment has been identified in excess of credit discounts resulting in additional reserves.  these additional reserves are included in the allowance for loan losses related to purchased impaired loans and were $3,713 and $6,672 as of september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  at september30, 2013, the outstanding balance of purchased impaired loans from american community bancshares, inc. ("american community"), which includes principal, interest and fees due, was $91,806.  because of the uncertainty of the expected cash flows, the company is accounting for each purchased impaired loan under the cost recovery method, in which all cash payments are applied to principal.  thus, there is no accretable yield associated with the above loans.  troubled debt restructured loans.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans outstanding as of september30, 2013 was $21.3 million with related reserves of $519,791.  approximately $16.0 million of troubled debt restructured loans are current and  accruing interest as of september30, 2013, as these loans have sufficient evidence of paying according to the new restructured terms.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans

management's best estimate for probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.  the primary risks inherent in the bank's loan portfolio, including the adequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses, are based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these risks, and the related loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by direct charges to provision expense. losses on loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible. recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance for loan losses. the provision for loan losses was $40,000 for the quarter ended september30, 2013 as compared to $4.3 million for the quarter ended september 30, 2012. the provision expense is determined by management  with the use of the bank's allowance for loan losses model. the components of the model are specific reserves for impaired loans and a general allocation for unimpaired loans.  the general allocation has two components, an estimate based on historical loss experience and an additional estimate based on internal and external environmental factors due to the uncertainty of historical loss experience in predicting current embedded losses in the portfolio that will be realized in the future.  the portion of the general allocation on environmental factors includes estimates of losses related to interest rate trends, unemployment trends, real estate characteristics, past due and nonaccrual trends, watch list trends, charge-off trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.   the real estate characteristics component includes trends in real estate concentrations, exceptions to fdic guidelines for loan-to-value ratios, and changes in real estate market values.  other factors impacting the allowance at september30, 2013 were watch list trends, unemployment rate trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.  the following tables present changes in the allowance for loan losses for the three and

allowance balance for unimpaired loans grouped by loan type.  the company's loan charge-off policy for all loan classes is to charge down loans to net realizable value once a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable, and the underlying collateral shortfall is assessed.  unsecured loans (primarily consumer loans) are charged off against the reserve once the loan becomes 90 days past due or it is determined that a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  secured loans (primarily construction, real estate, commercial and other loans) are moved to nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable and supporting collateral is not considered to be sufficient to cover potential losses.  nonaccrual loans are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if all or a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  nonaccrual loans that are determined to be solely collateral dependent are promptly charged down to net realizable value upon determination that they are impaired.  in addition to the allowance for loan losses, the company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments. unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by loan classification. these classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 28table of contentseconomic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the reserve for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $193,385 and $182,000 as of september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the company maintains reserves for mortgage loans sold to agencies and investors in the event that, either through error or disagreement between the parties, the company is required to indemnify the purchase. the reserves take into consideration risks associated with underwriting, key factors in the mortgage industry, loans with specific reserve requirements, past due loans and potential indemnification by the company. reserves are estimated based on consideration of factors in the mortgage industry such as declining collateral values and rising levels of delinquency, default and foreclosure, coupled with increased incidents of quality reviews at all levels of the mortgage industry seeking justification for pushing back losses to loan originators and wholesalers. as of september30, 2013, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $365,211, and charges against reserves for the nine months ended september30, 2013 were $83,198.  there were no charges against reserves for the three months ended september 30, 2013.  for the three months ended september30, 2013, the company recorded $6,621 in provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $65.1 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  for the nine months ended september30, 2013, the company recorded $1.3 million in negative provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $214.7 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  reduction in provisions for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 were the result of decreased mortgage activity as sidus financial, llc ("sidus") started to significantly scale back its wholesale operations and completely exited the wholesale market in 2012.  the company saw improvements in historical loss experience, and declines in specific reserves as claims were paid and settled from previously established reserves.  in addition, sidus financial discontinued its business and was dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the north carolina limited liability company act which limited future liability for loans previously sold by sidus financial.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, the company recorded $204,861 and $234,576 in provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure, respectively.  charges against reserves for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012 were $115,238 and $(157,868) , respectively.   for the three and nine ended september30, 2013 and 2012, the company did not repurchase any mortgage loans sold.  as of december31, 2012, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $1.7 million related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on approximately $9.5 billion in loans sold.11. fair valuethe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. available-for-sale securities, interest rate swaps, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and forward sale loan commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, from time to time, the company may be required to record other assets at fair value, such as loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments usually involve writing the asset down to fair value or the lower of cost or market value. following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. available-for-sale investment securitiesavailable-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, u.s. treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.interest rate swapsinterest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models run by a third-party on a monthly basis.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.   as a result, the company classifies interest rate swaps as level 3.  yadkin financial

used in prior periods.the following table presents a rollforward of mortgage servicing rights for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013 and 2012 and shows that the mortgage servicing

carried at lower of cost or market value. the fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. the changes in fair value of the assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.  as such, the company classifies loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a level 2 asset.  at september30, 2013, the cost of the company's mortgage loans held-for-sale was less than the market value.  accordingly, the company's loans held-for-sale are carried at cost. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.impaired loansthe company does not record loans held-for-investment at fair value on a recurring basis. however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs), market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. at september30, 2013, the majority of impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral by obtaining third-party appraisals and applying liquidity discounts.  third party appraisals are obtained at least annually for all impaired loans greater than $250,000.  the company records impaired loans as nonrecurring level 3. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.other real estate ownedother real estate owned (‚Äúoreo‚Äù) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to oreo. subsequently, oreo is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs). when the fair value of the collateral is measured due to further deterioration in the value of the oreo since initial recognition, the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level 3. the current carrying value of oreo at september30, 2013 is $3.0 million.  at december31, 2012 the carrying value of oreo was $8.7 million. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 32table of contentsthe following table presents assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring

in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate swap agreements is the discount rate. a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. the discount rate is determined by the third-party by obtaining third party market quotes from reuters, which handle up to 30 year swap maturities.  the company's asset liability management team periodically reviews the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate lock commitments is the pull through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments to increase if in a gain position, or decrease if in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company's mortgage banking division.the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the company's mortgage servicing rights are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions.  the company utilizes an independent third-party to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through use of a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income based on observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 34table of contentsan estimated fair value. to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the fair value and constant prepayment

services. yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 36table of contentsfor certain categories of loans, such as installment and commercial loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. the cost of fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale approximates the lower of cost or market as these loans are typically sold within 60 days of origination. fair values for adjustable-rate mortgages are based on quoted market prices of similar loans adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  the company applied an additional illiquidity discount in the amount of 10.0%.the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the fhlb stock.the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively. the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts is estimated using the present value of the projected cash flows using rates currently offered for similar deposits with similar maturities.the fair values of borrowings are based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate for debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements.  due to limited markets, discount rates applied to junior subordinated debt are based on estimated cost to raise capital, which was 8% as of september 30, 2013.  the carrying values of short-term borrowings, including overnight, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and fhlb advances, approximates the fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments.  the company's credit risk is not material to calculation of fair value because these borrowings are collateralized. the carrying values of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair values due to the short-term duration.interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.interest rate locks and forward loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing release premium, origination income net of origination costs, and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.13.  business segment informationthe company has two reportable segments, including banking activities and mortgage banking activities.  in the fourth quarter of 2012, a decision was made by management to sell a reinsurance subsidiary held by sidus.  as a result of this decision, sidus reclassified its investment in the reinsurance subsidiary to held for sale and wrote down its investment by $1.0 million to the estimated fair value at december31, 2012.  the sale of the subsidiary closed in the first quarter of 2013.  in addition, at the beginning of 2013, the company dissolved sidus and is no longer doing business as sidus.  all mortgage banking activity beginning in 2013 is at the bank.  the following table details the results of operations for the three

report september 30, 2013 40table of contentsour net deferred tax asset was $26.6 million at september30, 2013 and $31.4 million at december 31, 2012.  a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  all available evidence, both positive and negative, is used in the consideration to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is required.  at september30, 2013, the company considered the following negative and positive evidence in its evaluation of deferred tax assets:‚Ä¢the company is in a cumulative tax loss position for the 3-year period ending september30, 2013 of $(13.4)

quarter ended september30, 2013 as provisions for loan losses were $40,000 for the quarter.  excluding losses of $49 million sustained in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the accelerated asset disposition plan, the company has recorded $37 million in pre-tax income for eight previous consecutive quarters as credit quality has improved and net interest margin has increased over the past year.     significance:  high‚Ä¢the company is projecting income on a pretax basis, as well as taxable income, for the future periods 2013-2015.  the budgeted provision for loan losses is a key driver of the resulting income.  also, as discussed below, credit quality metrics have significantly improved.  while management believes the 2010, 2011 and 2012 levels of provision are indicative of the worst economic downturn in recent history and will not be repeated, it is important to understand why future losses are not projected at these levels.  in the three year period ended december 31, 2012, management was proactive in charging down collateral dependent loans that are impaired to current market values.   significance:  moderate‚Ä¢in 2012, the company completed a $45 million private placement offering pursuant to which several institutional investors and members of the board and management purchased shares of preferred stock.  in connection with this private placement, the company converted approximately $21 million of its outstanding series t and series t-acb preferred shares to common shares.   as of september30, 2013, the company's leverage ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.1%, 13.2%, and 14.4%.  significance: moderate‚Ä¢credit quality has improved over the past twelve months, including significant decreases in classified loans and nonperforming loans.  credit losses have shown a dramatic reduction in the first half of 2013 and overall nonperforming loans are down $39.2 million since september 30, 2012.   nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.15% as of september30, 2013 as compared to 4.13% as of september 30, 2012.  in addition, allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased from 47.43% at september 30, 2012 to 117.57% at september30, 2013.  significance:  high‚Ä¢management is not aware of any unsettled circumstances that, if resolved, would adversely affect future operations or earnings.  significance:  low‚Ä¢federal net operating losses can be deducted over the twenty year carryforward period.  currently, management is projecting full utilization of these tax benefits

of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off;‚Ä¢the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods;‚Ä¢results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or writedown

including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, natural disasters, which could be exacerbated by potential climate change, and international instability;‚Ä¢changes in deposit flows;‚Ä¢changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines;‚Ä¢changes in the

exacerbated by the developments in national and international financial markets that have persisted over the past several years, and we are unable to predict what effect these uncertain market conditions will continue to have on us.  there can be no assurance that these unprecedented developments will not continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.we have based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee you that these expectations will be achieved. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.overviewthe following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013  and 2012 and also analyzes our financial condition as of september30, 2013 as compared to december31, 2012.  like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments.  our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.  consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.  another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.  we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings.  in the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.  we describe the various components of this noninterest income, as well as our noninterest expense, in the following discussion.the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements.  we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.the company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or occurrences after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.in 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and an amendment to both the company's and the bank's articles of incorporation changing their name to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to  share data have yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 45table of contentsbeen adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.changes in financial positiontotal assets at september30, 2013 were $1,813.5 million, a decrease of $109.9 million, or 5.7%, compared to assets of $1,923.4 million at december31, 2012.  the loan portfolio, net of allowance for losses, was $1,312.4 million compared to $1,284.4 million at december31, 2012.  gross loans held-for-investment increased by $23.9 million, or 1.8% as loan production has increased over the past nine months.  the allowance for loan losses decreased $4.1 million driven primarily by decreases in classified loans for the nine months ended september30, 2013 and decreased charge-offs in 2013 as compared to 2012. total watch list and substandard loans were $84.2 million as compared to $102.9 million as of december31, 2012, a decrease of $18.7 million.   see note 10 above entitled ‚Äúloans and allowance for loan losses‚Äù for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses.mortgage loans held-for-sale decreased by $15.0 million, or 54.4%, from december31, 2012 to september30, 2013 as the bank continued its strategy of selling mortgage loans mostly to various investors with servicing rights released and to a lesser extent to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation with servicing rights retained.   these loans are normally held for a period of two to three weeks before being sold to investors.  mortgage loans closed in the first nine months of 2013 ranged from a low of $18.0 million in september 2013 to a high of $30.9 million in may 2013 and totaled $217.1 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2013.  mortgage loans closed during the nine months ended september 30, 2012 totaled $237.3 million.   decrease in mortgage activity, including refinance activity, is the result of an increase in rates and volatility.the securities portfolio decreased from $343.1 million at december31, 2012, to $328.7 million at september30, 2013, a decrease of $14.4 million due to purchases of $112.7 million, offset by paydowns and maturities of $73.0 million and sales of $42.5 million in 2013.  the portfolio is comprised of securities of u.s. government agencies (5.0%), mortgage-backed securities (60.7%), state and municipal securities (33.4%), and publicly traded common and preferred stocks (0.9%).  other assets increased $1.1 million due largely to an increase in mortgage servicing rights of $1.9 million and an increase in other prepaid expense of $254,000 offset by a $652,000 reduction in prepaid fdic expense and a $368,000 decrease in other misc assets.  oreo decreased $5.7 million as the result of sales in the amount of $9.3 million, offset by transfers in the amount of $3.6 million for the nine months ended september30, 2013.  premises and equipment decreased $799,000, or 1.91% as the company sold one of its branches, including the building and furniture and fixtures.  deferred tax assets also decreased $4.8 million as the company recorded $22.0 million in income before taxes for the year 2013, utilizing net operating loss carryforwards.  see note 14 for detailed information regarding deferred tax assets.deposits decreased $140.3 million, or 8.6%, comparing september30, 2013 to december31, 2012. overall, noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $7.0 million, or 2.5%, certificates of deposit (‚Äúcods‚Äù) over $100,000 decreased $79.4 million, or 25.1%, and other cods decreased $106.0 million, or 25.4%, while now, savings, and money market accounts increased $52.0 million, or 8.3%, management continues to focus on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand and now accounts through the use of marketing efforts and interest rates.borrowed funds increased $25.9 million, or 24.7%, comparing september30, 2013 to december31, 2012 due to additional fhlb advances in the amount of $40.0 million as an effort to secure low-rate funding as $20 million in deposits were sold during the quarter as part of the creedmoor branch sale.  this increase was offset by a $14.1 million decrease in repurchase agreements. long term borrowings included $35.0 million in trust preferred securities and advances from the fhlb of $25.3 million.  the american community merger added $10.4 million in trust preferred securities in 2007 at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.80% and will mature in 2033.  yadkin valley statutory trust i (‚Äúthe trust‚Äù) issued $25.8 million in trust preferred securities at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 1.32%. the trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, and can be called by the trust without penalty. other liabilities, capital lease obligations and accrued interest payable combined decreased by $3.6 million, or 22.8%, from december31, 2012 to september30, 2013.  decreases in other liabilities resulted primarily from a $1.7 million decrease in liability related to the sale of the reinsurance subsidiary as well as a $1.4 million reduction in reserves established for sold loans.  significant negative provisions for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 were the result of decreased mortgage activity as sidus financial started to significantly scale back its wholesale operations and completely exited the wholesale market in 2012.  the company saw improvements in historical loss experience, and declines in specific reserves as claims were paid and settled from previously established reserves.  in addition, sidus financial discontinued its business and was dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the north carolina limited liability company act which limited future liability for loans previously sold by sidus financial. in addition, there was a $702,000 decrease in accrued interest payable as deposits have decreased year-over-year. yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 46table of contentsat september30, 2013, total shareholders' equity was $178.9 million, or a book value of $10.47 per common share, compared to $170.8 million, or a book value of $9.93 per common share, at december31, 2012.  the company's equity to assets ratio was 9.86% and 8.88%, at september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  in order to be considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù, a bank must exceed total risk-based capital ratios of 10%, and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6% and leverage ratios of 5%. in addition, we have committed to regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% to be classified as well-capitalized. our goal has been to maintain a ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù status for the bank since failure to meet or exceed this classification affects how regulatory applications for certain activities, including acquisitions, and continuation and expansion of existing activities, are evaluated and could make our customers and potential investors less confident in our bank. the following table sets forth the company's and the bank's various capital ratios as of september30, 2013 and december31, 2012.  the company and the bank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios as of september30, 2013, as well as the ratios to be considered "well capitalized."  september 30, 2013december 31, 2012holdingcompanybankholdingcompanybanktotal risk-based capital ratio14.4%14.2%13.3%13.0%tier 1 risk-based capital ratio13.2%12.9%12.2%11.7%leverage ratio11.1%10.9%9.2%8.9%management of equity is a critical aspect of capital management in any business.  the determination of the appropriate amount of equity for a regulated financial institution is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the amount of capital needed to meet regulatory requirements, the amount of ‚Äúrisk equity‚Äù the business requires and balance sheet leverage.in july 2013, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the ‚Äúfederal reserve‚Äù) announced its approval of a final rule to implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, among other changes required by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. the framework requires banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, taking into account the impact of risk. the approved rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as well as a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking institutions. for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations, the rule includes a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance sheet exposures. in terms of quality of capital, the final rule emphasizes common equity tier 1 capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. it also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. the changes begin to take effect for the bank in january 2015.  the ultimate impact of the u.s. implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed.  to be categorized as well capitalized, the company and the bank each must maintain minimum amounts and ratios.  at september30, 2013, the company is well-capitalized for regulatory purposes both at the bank and holding company level, however the bank has committed to regulators that it will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% which it exceeded at september30, 2013. liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market riskthe bank derives the majority of its liquidity from its core deposit base and to a lesser extent from wholesale borrowing.  the balance sheet liquidity ratio, measured by the sum of cash (less reserve requirements), investments, and loans held-for-sale reduced by pledged securities, as compared to deposits and short-term borrowings, was 19.3% at september30, 2013 compared to 23.2% at december 31, 2012.  additional liquidity is provided by $87.7 million in unused credit including federal funds purchased lines provided by correspondent banks as well as credit availability from the fhlb. in addition, the bank has unpledged marketable securities of $243.0 million available for use as a source of collateral.  at september30, 2013, brokered deposits totaled $99,553, or 0.01% of total deposits.  brokered certificates of deposit are primarily short-term with maturities of nine months or less.  the bank also maintains a brokered deposit now account to add municipal deposits totaling $1,299 at september30, 2013.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 47table of contentsthe bank contracted with promontory interfinancial network ("promontory") in 2008 for various services including wholesale cod funding. promontory's cdars¬Æ product, one-way buysm, enables the bank to bid on a weekly basis through a private auction for cod terms ranging from four weeks to 260weeks (approximately five years) with settlement available each thursday.  there were no outstanding funds acquired through the one-way buy product at september30, 2013 or december 31, 2012. promontory also provides a product, cdars¬Æ reciprocal, which allows the bank's customers to place funds in excess of the fdic insurance limit with promontory's network of participating banks so that the customer is fully insured for the amount deposited. promontory provides reciprocating funds to the bank from funds placed at other banks by their customers. the bank sets its customers' interest rates when they place deposits through the network and pays/receives the rate difference to/from the other banks whose reciprocal funds are held by the bank. the overall impact of this process is that the bank effectively pays the rate offered to its relationship customer. therefore, the bank does not consider these funds to be wholesale or brokered funds. in compliance with fdic reporting requirements, the bank includes reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits in its quarterly federal financial institutions examination council call report.  cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits totaled $166,506 at september30, 2013 and $165,000 at december 31, 2012.management continues to assess interest rate risk internally and by utilizing outside sources.  the balance sheet is asset sensitive over a three-month period, meaning that there will be more assets than liabilities immediately repricing as market rates change. over a period of twelve months, the balance sheet remains slightly asset sensitive. we generally would benefit from increasing market interest rates when we have an asset-sensitive, or a positive interest rate gap, and we would generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we have liability-sensitive, or a negative interest rate gap.  the company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.  the company's exposure to market risk is reviewed regularly by management.results of operationsnet income for the quarter ended september30, 2013 was $4.7 million before preferred dividends, compared to net income of $757,000 in the same period of 2012.  net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended september30, 2013 was $4.3 million.   net loss to common shareholders for the three month period ended september30, 2012 was $81,000.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.30 for the three month period ended september30, 2013.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.00 for the three month period ended september30, 2012.  on an annualized basis, first quarter results represent a return on average assets of 0.95% at september30, 2013 compared to

preferred dividends, compared to net income of $15.2 million in the same period of 2012.  net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended september30, 2013 was $12.7 million, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $12.7 million for the nine months ended september30, 2012.  basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.90 and $0.89, respectively,

net income included a reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which resulted in an income tax benefit of $9.3 million for the nine months ended september30, 2012.net interest incomenet interest income, the largest contributor to earnings, increased $947,000, or 6.2%, to $16.1 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared with $15.2 million in the same period of 2012.  the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 44.4% as average interest bearing deposits are down 11% from the prior year and deposit costs are declining as time deposits continue to reprice at lower rates.   the net interest margin increased to 3.93% in the third quarter of 2013 from 3.37% in the third quarter of 2012.    the increase in net interest margin is primarily related to a decrease in deposit yields and borrowings cost.  deposit yields have decreased as management focused efforts on shifting the deposit mix yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 48table of contentsfrom higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing now and money market accounts.  the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of changing rates on net interest income.  net interest income for the nine months ended september30, 2013 increased to $47.3 million from $46.2 million when compared to the same period in 2012.  the net interest margin increased to 3.80% in the first nine months of 2013 from 3.46% in the first nine months of 2012.   the company maintains an

quarterly report september 30, 2013 49table of contentsprovisions and allowance for loan lossesadequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses of the bank is a significant estimate that is based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses was $21.0 million at september30, 2013, or 1.58% of loans held-for-investment, as compared to $25.1 million, or 1.92% of loans held-for-investment, at december31, 2012.  decreases in the allowance for loan losses were due to decreased charge-offs and decreased criticized loans in the first nine months of 2013.  decreases in criticized loans were due to improvements in loans 30-89 days past due, payoffs and overall improvements in underlying credit exposures.   the allowance model is applied to the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for performing loans grouped by loan type.  out of the $21.0 million in total allowance for loan losses at september30, 2013, the specific allowance for impaired loans accounted for $409,000, down from $1.4 million at year end as impaired loans have decreased since december 31, 2012.  see discussion below in "nonperforming assets" for further discussion of nonaccrual relationships.  the remaining general allowance, $20.6 million, was attributed to performing loans and was down from $23.7 million at year end.  the general allowance, as a percent of loans not individually reviewed for impairment was 1.58% as of september30, 2013 as compared to 1.86% as of december31, 2012.  the decrease in the general allowance was driven primarily by a decrease in charge-offs, as well as a decrease in substandard and watch loans of $18.7 million which resulted from a few significant payoffs and improvements in past dues and underlying credit exposures of previously classified loans.  there were decreased provisions in many of the loan types including negative provisions for the nine months ended september30, 2013 for owner-occupied and non owner-occupied commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential, multifamily and home equity lines of credit as charge-offs, nonaccruals and classified loans in these categories decreased.net loan charge offs were $2.0 million, or 0.58% (annualized), of average loans, for the three months ended september30, 2013 compared to $5.8 million, or 1.66% (annualized), of average loans for the three months ended september 30, 2012.  decrease in charge-offs is related to a significant decrease in problem loans over the past 12 months.  charge-offs over the past three years have been elevated due to declines in real estate values and overall economic conditions.   for the nine months ended september30, 2013, net loan charge offs were $4.5 million, or 0.45% (annualized) of average loans compared to $14.4 million, or 1.36% (annualized) of average loans, for the nine months ended september 30, 2012.management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the bank's loan portfolio as of september30, 2013. no assurance can be given in this regard, however, especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in the bank's market areas. management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and will consider future changes to the allowance that may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions.  additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the bank's allowance for loan losses.  such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses. the downturn experienced in the real estate market from 2008 through 2011 resulted in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures.  in some cases, that downturn resulted in significant impairments to the value of collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.  management aggressively monitors its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with significant weaknesses.  the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. if real estate values begin to decline in the future, it is more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and our net charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. assurances cannot be made either (1) that further charges to the allowance account will not be significant in relation to the normal activity or (2) that further evaluation of the loan portfolio based on prevailing conditions may not require sizable additions to the allowance and charges to provision expense. our real estate portfolio has approximately $129.0 million of construction loans, $575.5 million of commercial real estate loans, $171.7 million in first lien mortgage loans, $193.3 million in home equity lines of credit and $40.7 million in multifamily mortgage loans as of september30, 2013. we consider our construction and junior lien mortgage loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio.  construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed into properties yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 50table of contentssuch as sub-divisions or speculative houses. normally, these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the developed property.  in addition, management continues to evaluate closely junior lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.  given the slow economic recovery, and real estate values that have been slow to recover, the company recognizes that it may experience some loss in these portfolios, and management continues to monitor borrower financials,  ltvs, and first lien positions.   the significance of both construction and commercial real estate loans to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due.   loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and commercial real estate loans were $1.4 million and $392,000, respectively, for the nine months ended september30, 2013.  for the nine months ended september30, 2012, net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and commercial real estate loans were $7.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively.   as of september30, 2013, $8.0 million of our real estate loans had interest reserves including both borrower and bank funded, compared to $9.8 million as of december31, 2012.  there is a risk that an interest reserve could mask problems with a borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt consistent with the terms and conditions of the loan obligation, therefore the company has implemented review policies and internal controls to identify and monitor all loans with interest reserves.  nonperforming assetstotal nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due but still accruing, and foreclosed real estate) decreased from $31.6 million at december31, 2012 to $20.9 million at september30, 2013.  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.15% as of september30, 2013 as compared to 1.64% as of december31, 2012, due primarily to a decrease in foreclosed real estate since december31, 2012 as the company sold over $5 million in foreclosed properties in a recent auction.  total nonaccrual loans decreased from $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, at december 31, 2012 to $17.9 million, or 1.33% of total loans, at september30, 2013.  we have analyzed our nonperforming loans to determine what we believe is the amount needed to reserve in the allowance for loan losses based on an assessment of the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan.   we have downgraded loans for which the probability of collection is uncertain and written down oreo property values where net realizable values have declined.  specific allowance for nonperforming loans accounted for $409,000, down from $1.4 million at year end, due to a decrease in impaired loans since december 31, 2012.approximately 63% of loans in nonaccrual status are currently not past due 30 days or more. the total number of loans on nonaccrual has decreased from 315 to 203 since december 31, 2012. the average nonaccrual loan balance is $88,000 and $71,000 as of september30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively. at september30, 2013, 89% of the nonaccrual loans were secured by real estate.the largest amount of nonaccrual loans for one customer relationship totaled $2.3 million. this relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase and refinance of real estate, acquisition of equipment and related operating expenses. this relationship was charged down to fair market value in the third quarter of 2013. nonaccrual loans also include three other large relationships each totaling $1.8 million, $1.4 million, and $1.0 million respectively as of september 30, 2013. the first of these nonaccrual relationships consists of one loan that was originally used for working capital purposes and is secured by real estate, account receivables, inventory and equipment. this loan does not have any specific reserves as of september 30, 2013. the second relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase of two businesses and secured by the real estate. this relationship does not have any specific reserve assigned to it as of september 30, 2013. the third relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase and refinance of real estate, lease debt, and related operating expenses and secured by the real estate. this loan does not have any reserve assigned to it as of september 30, 2013. all of these loans have been placed in nonaccrual status because of concerns for the customers' continued ability to pay, collateral deterioration and depressed future industry outlook.noninterest incomenoninterest income consists of all revenues that are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets.  total noninterest income increased approximately $716,000, or 15.3%, comparing the third quarters of 2013 and 2012 as the prior year included a loss on sale of loans in the amount of $900,000.   other increases include a gain on sale of a branch in the amount of $310,000 and an increase in mortgage banking income of $114,000, or 7.1% which resulted primarily from an increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights.   other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts increased by $17,000, or 1.3%, due primarily to an increase in service charges on now and money market accounts, business checking accounts, and regular checking accounts of $104,000 as yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 51table of contentschecking and savings accounts have increased $81 million since the prior year.  these increases were offset by a $92,000 decrease in nsf (non-sufficient funds) and odp (overdraft privilege charges).  ‚Ä¢other service fees increased $402,000 when comparing the third quarter of 2013 to the prior year due to an increase of $131,000 in commissions and fees on annuity and mutual fund sales and investment service fee income.   increase in investment service fees and commissions was due to an increase in investment activity in 2013.  atm and debit card fee income also increased $292,000 as compared to the third quarter of 2012 as incentive fees related to the signing of a new contract in 2012 are earned over the life of the contract.  ‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities decreased $1,095,000 as fewer investments were sold in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 2012.‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by $7,000, or 4.4%, during the three month period ended september30, 2013.‚Ä¢mortgage banking income increased approximately $114,000 for the third quarter of 2013 as servicing income including fair market value adjustments for mortgage servicing rights increased $1.7 million from the prior year due to an increase in mortgage loans serviced from $296 million in september 2012 to $401 million in september 2013.  this increase was offset by a decrease in overall gain on sale of loans which is due primarily to a slowdown in the velocity of rate increases during the quarter, which impacts our mortgage income. ‚Ä¢other income increased by approximately $75,000, or 26.5%, for the third quarter of 2013.  this increase is primarily due to income received on a cost method investment in the amount of $258,000 as the investment company became publicly traded during the quarter.  this increase was offset by the fact that prior year other income included a $150,000 settlement on rental income owed from the cancellation of leased rental property.‚Ä¢also included in noninterest income for the quarter ended september 30, 2013 is a $310,000 gain on sale of a branch , including property and equipment as well as loans and deposits.  noninterest income for the quarter ended september 30, 2012 included a $900,000 loss on sale of loans as the company sold a single loan relationship for a loss.for the nine months ended september 30, 2013, total noninterest income increased approximately $4.6 million, or 36.9%, as compared to the nine months ended september 30, 2012.  an increase in the mortgage banking activities of $3.1 million made up the majority of the increase, due primarily to $1.3 million in negative provisions recorded related to reserves on sold loans and an increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights of $1.7 million.  other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts increased $36,000, or 0.9%, as service charges on business checking accounts , regular checking accounts, and money market and now accounts increased $223,000.   these increases were partially offset by a decrease in nsf (including overdraft privilege) of $196,000.‚Ä¢the increase in other service fees of $941,000 was due primarily to an increase in investment service fees and commissions of $692,000 as investment activity has increased in 2013 and an increase in atm and debit card fee income of $275,000 as compared to the prior year as incentive fees related to the signing of a new contract in late 2012 are earned over the life of the contract.‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities decreased $1,119,000, or 67.9% due to decreased sales activity during the nine months ended september30, 2013 as compared to 2012.‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by 4.0% during the nine months ended september30, 2013.‚Ä¢mortgage banking activities increased approximately $3.1 million, or 71.0% for the nine months ended september30, 2013 as $1.3 million in negative provisions were recorded related to reserves on sold loans and the fair value of servicing rights increased $1.7 million as compared to the prior year due to an increase in mortgage loans serviced from $296 million in september 2012 to $401 million in september 2013.  decrease in mortgage activity is the result of an increase in mortgage rates over the past nine months.‚Ä¢other income increased by approximately $124,000, or 29.9%, year-to-date primarily due to income received on an cost method investment in the amount of $241,000 as the investment company became a publicly traded company.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 52table of contentsthis increase was offset by the fact that prior year other income included a $150,000 settlement on rental income owed from the cancellation of leased rental property.‚Ä¢also included in noninterest income for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 is a $310,000 gain on sale of a branch , including property and equipment as well as loans and deposits.  prior year noninterest income included a $900,000 loss on sale of loans as the company sold a single loan relationship for a loss as compared to a $374,000 gain on sale of loans in the current year.noninterest expensetotal noninterest expenses were $14.2 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $14.8 million in the same period of 2012, a decrease of $642,000, or 4.3%.   noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and all other operating costs.  noninterest expense to average assets for the quarter ended september30, 2013 and 2012 was 0.79%, and 0.76%, respectively.  noninterest expense to average assets for the nine months ended september30, 2013 and 2012 was 2.31%, and 2.27%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the three months ended september30, 2013 and 2012 were 63.47% and 66.46%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the nine months ended september30, 2013 and 2012 were 65.51% and 65.21%, respectively.  the efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expenses less amortization of intangibles and gains on sale of other real estate owned to the total of the taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income.  the following is a summary of the fluctuations for the three and nine ended september30, 2013 as compared to september30, 2012:‚Ä¢quarter-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $866,000, or 12.5%.  the major components of this increase are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased $299,000 due to the addition of several new managerial positions across the company since september 2012, as well as annual increases.  incentive compensation also increased $936,000 as the company began accruing for a new company wide incentive program for all employees in 2013.  offsetting these increases were a $319,000 decrease in commissions and a $470,000 decrease in other miscellaneous personnel expense which includes recruiting fees and boli expenses.‚Ä¢year-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 19.3%.  the major components of this increase are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased by $1.3 million due to personnel additions and annual increases. related payroll taxes also increased $214,000 and incentive compensation increased $2.3 million due to the new incentive program noted above.‚Ä¢occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $188,000, or 10.4%, for the quarter and $307,000, or 5.6%, for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 due to an increase in software and equipment maintenance costs.  ‚Ä¢advertising and marketing expense increased by $245,000, or 237.9%, comparing the third quarter 2013 with the third quarter 2012.  year-to-date advertising and marketing expense increased by $757,000, or 271.3%.  the increases are the direct result of a rebranding project announced in early 2013, including a company and bank name change.‚Ä¢data processing expense decreased $82,000, or 18.0%, for the quarter and $177,000, or 13.7% year-to-date due to the implementation of live branch capture in 2013 which reduced daily courier service costs and provides additional efficiencies.  ‚Ä¢communication expense increased $36,000, or 11.5%, for the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012.  year-to-date communications expense increased $2,000, or 0.2%.  ‚Ä¢fdic assessment expenses decreased $287,000 for the quarter and $407,000 year-to-date, due primarily to a decrease in assessment rates.  in addition, deposits have decreased 10% since the third quarter of 2012.   ‚Ä¢net cost of operation of other real estate owned decreased $1.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2012 as the company recorded $90,000 in losses on sales for the quarter ended september 30, 2013 as compared to $1.2 million in writedowns and losses recorded in the third quarter of 2012.  net cost of operation of other real estate owned decreased $6.2 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year.  $1.1 million in gains on sales were recorded in 2013 as the turnout and sales from the auction announced in late 2012 were higher than anticipated.  in the prior year, the company recorded losses on sales and writedowns of $4.4 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2012.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report september 30, 2013 53table of contents‚Ä¢loan collection fees decreased $8,000, or 3.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2012  and decreased $58,000, or 8.5%, year-to-date as past due and nonperforming loans have decreased since 2012.‚Ä¢other professional fees decreased $254,000 for the quarter and $65,000 year-to-date when compared to the prior year due to timing and fees related to internal audit and external credit reviews were lower than anticipated, thus resulting in a decrease in accruals for the periods.‚Ä¢quarter-to-date other operating expenses decreased by $171,000, or 7.6%.     decreases include a $220,000 decrease in attorney fees as the third quarter of 2012 included fees related to the loan sale, and a $134,000 decrease in appraisal fees which were significantly higher in the third quarter of 2012 due to the anticipated loan and oreo sales.  in addition, training expense decreased $131,000 as prior year expenses included a company wide training initiative. ‚Ä¢year-to-date other operating expenses increased approximately $326,000 or 4.9%.  increases include $377,000 in expenses related to the rebranding project and a $234,000  increase in transfer agent fees related to the recent 1-for-3 reverse stock split and additional filings required in connection with the recent capital raise.  increases also include a $109,000 increase in check losses and a $250,000 increase in software related expenses.  in addition, approximately $97,000 in third party fees were incurred related to recent projects including the capital raise, loan sale and oreo auction.  these increases were offset by a decrease in training expense of $556,000 as the company embarked on a training program for all employees in 2012 and a $318,000 decrease in attorney fees.income tax expensethe company recorded income tax expense for the three and nine months ended september30, 2013 of $2.6 million and $7.8 million, respectively.  the company recorded an income tax benefit for the nine months ended september30, 2012 of $9.4 million, as the valuation allowance for deferred taxes was reversed in the second quarter of 2012, and income tax expense of $54,000 for the three months ended september30, 2012.  the reversal of the allowance was based primarily on a return to profitability as the company has reported four consecutive quarters of net income, projected net income over the next 12 months and improving credit quality metrics.   the effective tax rate for the three months ended september30, 2013 was 35.7%  as compared to 6.7% for the three months ended september30, 2012, excluding the reversal of allowance.   the effective tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2013 was 35.6% as compared to 28.3% for the nine months ended september30, 2012, excluding the reversal of allowance.  see footnote 14 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense and deferred tax assets.  item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskmarket risk is the risk of

statements1.  significant accounting policiesbasis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin financial corporation  (the "company") and its subsidiary, yadkin bank (the "bank").  on july 1, 2006, the bank became a subsidiary of the company through a one for one share exchange of the then outstanding 10,648,300 shares.  the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial statements and with instructions to form 10-q and regulation s-x.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for complete financial statements.  because the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included with the company's 2012 annual report on form 10-k (the "2012 form 10-k") filed with the securities and exchange commission (‚Äúsec‚Äù) on february 28, 2013.  operating results, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the year or other interim periods.in the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments, all of which are normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of june 30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 and 2012.  the accounting policies followed are set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the company's 2012 form 10-k.reclassifications - certain income and expenses reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation of mortgage banking activity income.  reclassifications include other service fees previously presented in service charges on deposit accounts and other expenses that are now recorded as a reduction in mortgage banking activity income.  the reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.2. new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardsin february 2013, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2013-02, "reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income" ("asu 2013-02"). this guidance is the culmination of the fasb's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci").  the amendments in asu 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. however, the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2012.  the company has adopted the standard and the adoption of asu 2013-02 did not have an impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows but did result in additional disclosures in footnote 15.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 7table of contents3.   stock-based compensationduring the three

evaluating the collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, and municipal securities were cash flows of the investment and the assessment of other relative economic factors.  securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at december31, 2012 include three collateralized mortgage obligations, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and two other securities.   the unrealized losses relate to securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to a shift in demand from non-governmental securities and municipals to u.s. treasury bonds and governmental agencies due to credit market concerns. the unrealized losses are not likely to reverse unless market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. none of the unrealized losses relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer's ability to honor redemption obligations.  it is not more likely than not that the company will have to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. for the three and six months ended june30, 2013, there were no securities available-for-sale deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (‚Äúotti‚Äù).   if management determines that an investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment, the loss is recognized in the income

securitiesthe aggregate cost of the company's cost method investments totaled $5,396,886 at june30, 2013 and $6,706,012 at december31, 2012.  cost method investments at june30, 2013 include $3,473,400 in federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock and $1,923,486 of investments in various trust and financial companies, which are included in other assets.  all cost method investments were evaluated for impairment at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012.  the following factors have been considered in determining the carrying amount of fhlb stock: 1) the recoverability of the par value, 2) the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all operational needs in the foreseeable future and would not need to dispose of the stock below recorded amounts, 3) redemptions and purchases of the stock are at the discretion of the fhlb, 4) the company believes the fhlb has the ability to absorb economic losses given the expectation that the various fhlbs' have a high degree of government support, and 5) the unrealized losses related to securities owned by the fhlb are manageable given the capital levels of the organization.   during the six months ended june 30, 2013, the company's investment in a financial services company was considered to be other than temporarily impaired and approximately $39,185 was charged-off.   the remaining value of the investment after the charge-off was $62,815 at june 30, 2013.  there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three months ended june 30, 2013.   there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012.6.  commitments and contingenciesin the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  at june30, 2013, the company had commitments outstanding of $301.7 million  for additional loan amounts.  commitments of the bank's mortgage lending department are excluded from this amount and discussed in the paragraph below.  additional commitments totaling $5.8 million were outstanding under standby letters of credit.  management does not expect any significant losses to result from these commitments. at june30, 2013, the bank had $32.5 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $54.8 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  see note 9 for additional disclosures on these derivative financial instruments.7.    earnings per common sharebasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting periods.  diluted net income available to common shareholders per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  the numerators of the basic net income per common share computations are the same as the numerators of the diluted net income per common share computations for all the periods presented.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three and six months ended june30, 2013 excludes

pursuant to section 53c-4-7 of which, the bank, as a north carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends if such distributions will not reduce its capital below its applicable ‚Äúrequired capital.‚Äù the bank's ‚Äúrequired capital‚Äù is that amount of capital required for the bank to be deemed ‚Äúadequately capitalized‚Äù under applicable federal regulatory capital ratios.  currently, the bank exceeds each of these federal regulatory capital ratios. however, the bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends to the holding company without prior approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation (the ‚Äúfdic‚Äù) and the north carolina banking commissioner. in addition, the company has committed to the regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.0%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% to be classified as well-capitalized.   the bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is 10.3% at june 30, 2013 and exceeds committed levels.as further explained in note 16, other events, during the quarter, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and amendments to the company's and the bank's articles of

derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.for derivatives that are economic hedges, but are not designated as hedging instruments or otherwise do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income during the period of change.as part of interest rate risk management, the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed-rate receivables to floating rates and certain fixed-rate obligations to floating rates.the interest rate swaps are used to provide fixed rate financing while managing interest rate risk and were not designated as hedges.  the interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month libor, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. the interest rate swaps are settled quarterly and mature on june 15, 2016.   the interest rate swaps each had a notional amount of $1.9 million at june30, 2013, representing the amount of fixed-rate receivables outstanding and liabilities outstanding, and are included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair value of $154,068.   the company had a gain of $25,543 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $25,543 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended june30, 2013.  the company had a gain of $41,939 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $41,939 on the interest rate swap liability for the six months ended june30, 2013.   the company had a gain of $3,513 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $3,513 on the interest rate swap liability for the quarter ended june30, 2012.  the company had a gain of $4,390 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $4,390 on the interest rate swap liability for the six months ended june30, 2012. the interest rate swaps had a notional amount of $2.0 million outstanding as of december31, 2012 and was included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair market value of $196,006.  all changes in fair value are recorded as other income within non-interest income.  fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts.the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing mortgage origination business. the bank's mortgage banking segment enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.  the primary risks managed by derivative instruments are these interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments.  interest rate lock commitments are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed rate loan commitments.  the period of time between the issuance of a loan commitment and the closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 10 to 60days. such interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments represent derivative instruments which are required to be carried at fair value. these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of the company's interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the balance sheet in other assets and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.  the fair value of the company's forward sales commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.at june30, 2013, the bank had $32.5 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $54.8 million of forward commitments outstanding for original commitments and outstanding mortgage loans held-for-sale under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 13table of contentsin other assets was

of forward sales commitments were $81,725 and $92,070 for the three and six months ended june30, 2013, respectively, and are included in mortgage banking activities income. recognition of gains and losses related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments were $57,457 and $(33,340) for the three and six months ended june30, 2013, respectively, and are included in mortgage banking activities income.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $90,269 and $293,298 for the three months ended june30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other income.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $76,777 and $288,669 for the six months ended june30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other income. at december31, 2012, the bank had $46.7 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $71.5 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other liabilities was $480,806 at december31, 2012.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in other assets was $872,844 at december31, 2012.10. loans and allowance for loan lossesgeneral.  the bank provides to its customers a full range of short- to medium-term commercial, agricultural, small business administration guaranteed, mortgage, home equity, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans.  the following table

net$1,291,837$1,284,355real estate loans.  real estate loans include construction and land development loans, commercial real estate loans, residential mortgages, and home equity lines of credit.commercial real estate loans totaled $570.9 million and $554.5 million at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  this lending has involved loans secured by owner-occupied commercial buildings for office, storage and warehouse space, as well as non-owner occupied commercial buildings. the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt.  loans secured by commercial real estate may be larger in size and may involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties.construction/development lending totaled $127.6 million and $132.0 million at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the bank originates one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower) and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre-sold homes.  the bank generally yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 14table of contentsreceives a pre-arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre-sold homes; however, the bank also engages in selected speculative housing lending to existing builder clients utilizing lots that the bank has a collateral interest in.  the bank also makes commercial real estate construction loans, primarily for owner-occupied properties.  the bank limits its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures.  residential one-to-four family loans amounted to $167.8 million and $168.6 million at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively. the bank's residential mortgage loans are typically construction loans that convert into permanent financing and are secured by properties located within the bank's market areas.  home equity lines of credit totaled $195.6 million and $191.9 million at june 30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively.  the bank's home equity lines of credit generally are variable rate lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties with interest only payment options during a draw period.  at the end of the draw period, the line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment with repayment terms of up to 30 years.  commercial loans.  at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, the bank's commercial loan portfolio totaled $168.4 million and $174.4 million, respectively. commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital, expansion, and other business purposes.  short-term working capital loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate.  lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength, cash flow, management and credit history of the borrower, and the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  with few exceptions, the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment.  commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans.  consumer loans.  loans to individuals (consumer loans) include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans.  consumer loans totaled $49.7 million and $51.7 million at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans, even if secured, if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, and equipment.  repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan.  consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss, illness and other personal factors.  the bank manages the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss.loan approvals.  the bank's loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations.  the guidelines address the type of loans that the bank seeks, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations.  all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  these limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness to the bank, including any indebtedness as a guarantor. the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the bank.  the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by independent, outside professionals experienced in loan review.  responsibility for loan review, loan underwriting, and approval resides with the chief credit officer position. on an annual basis, the board of directors of the bank determines officers lending authority.  authorities may include loans, letters of credit, overdrafts, uncollected funds and such other authorities as determined by the board of directors.substantially all of the company's loans have been granted to customers in the piedmont, foothills, northwestern mountains, and the research triangle regions of north carolina and the upstate region of south carolina.credit review and evaluation.  the bank has a credit review department that reports to the chief credit officer.  the focus of the department is on policy compliance and proper grading of higher credit risk loans as well as new and existing loans on a sample basis. additional reporting for problem/criticized assets has been developed along with an after-the-fact loan review.  a newly expanded enterprise risk management role also performs ongoing credit review and  evaluation  to help manage and assess overall credit risk for the company.the bank uses a risk grading program to facilitate the evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for real estate, commercial and consumer loans.  in this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers, reviewed by regional credit officers, and further reviewed by internal credit review analysts on a test basis.  the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank's market area.  every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 15table of contentsloans over $20,000 are risk graded on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 8 (loss).  acceptable loans at inception are grades 1 through 4, and these grades have underwriting requirements that at least meet the minimum requirements of a secondary market source.  if borrowers do not meet credit history requirements, other mitigating criteria such as substantial liquidity and low loan-to-value ratios could be considered and would generally have to be met in order to make the loan.  the bank's loan policy states that a guarantor may be necessary if reasonable doubt exists as to the borrower's ability to repay.  the board of directors has authorized the loan officers to have individual approval authority for risk grade 1 through 4 loans up to maximum exposure limits for each customer.  new or renewed loans that are graded 5 (special mention) or lower must have approval from a regional credit officer. any changes in risk assessments as determined by loan officers, credit administrators, regulatory examiners and management are also considered.  the risk grades, normally assigned by the loan officers when the loan is originated and reviewed by the regional credit officers, are based on several factors including historical data, current economic factors, composition of the portfolio, and evaluations of the total loan portfolio and assessments of credit quality within specific loan types.  in some cases, the risk grades are assigned by regional executives, depending upon dollar exposure.  because these factors are dynamic, the provision for loan losses can fluctuate.  credit quality reviews are based primarily on analysis of borrowers' cash flows, with asset values considered only as a second source of payment.   regional credit officers work with lenders in underwriting, structuring and risk grading the bank's credits.  the risk review officer focuses on lending policy compliance, credit risk grading, and credit risk reviews on larger dollar exposures.  management uses the information developed from the procedures above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio.  this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses.the following is a summary of the credit risk grade definitions for all loan types:‚Äú1‚Äù - high quality-  these loans represent a credit extension of the highest quality.  the borrower's historic (at least five years) cash flows manifest extremely large and stable margins of coverage.  balance sheets are conservative, well capitalized, and liquid.  after considering debt service for proposed and existing debt, projected cash flows continue to be strong and provide ample coverage. the borrower typically reflects broad geographic and product diversification and has access to alternative financial markets.  ‚Äú2‚Äù - good quality-  these loans have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment.  the borrower may have access to alternative sources of financing, but sources are not as widely available as they are to a higher graded borrower.  this loan carries a normal level of risk, with minimal loss exposure.  the borrower has the ability to perform according to the terms of the credit facility. the margins of cash flow coverage are satisfactory but vulnerable to more rapid deterioration than the highest quality loans.  ‚Äú3‚Äù - satisfactory-  the borrowers are a reasonable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations.  risk factors may include reliability of margins and cash flows, liquidity, dependence on a single product or industry, cyclical trends, depth of management, or limited access to alternative financing sources.  historic financial information may indicate erratic performance, but current trends are positive.  quality of financial information is adequate, but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher graded loans.  if adverse circumstances arise, the impact on the borrower may be significant. ‚Äú4‚Äù - satisfactory - merits attention-  these credit facilities have potential developing weaknesses that deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel.  if the developing weakness is not corrected or mitigated, there may be deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the bank's debt in the future.  ‚Äú5‚Äù - watch  or special mention -   these loans are typically existing loans, made using the passing grades outlined above, that have deteriorated to the point that cash flow is not consistently adequate to meet debt service or current debt service coverage is based on projections.  secondary sources of repayment may include specialized collateral or real estate that is not readily marketable or undeveloped, making timely collection in doubt. ‚Äú6‚Äù - substandard-  loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade are considered inadequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral.  these obligations, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have well-defined weaknesses related to adverse financial, managerial, economic, market, or political conditions jeopardizing repayment of principal and interest as originally intended.  clear loss potential, however, does not have to exist in any individual assets classified as substandard.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 16table of contents‚Äú7‚Äù - substandard impaired (also includes any loans over 90 days past due, excluding sold mortgages )-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú6,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  "7b"-  doubtful-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7b‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú7,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  such pending factors could include merger or liquidation, additional capital injection, refinancing plans, or perfection of liens on additional collateral.  loans in this classification are placed in non-accrual status, with collections applied to principal on the bank's books and evaluated for impairment.  all loans in this category are considered impaired and all material loans are evaluated for a specific reserve in accordance with asc 310-10 and the bank's alll methodology and specific reserve guidelines.‚Äú8‚Äù - loss-  loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of the bank.  such loans are to be charged-off or charged-down.  this classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but that it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.the following is a summary of credit quality indicators by class at june30, 2013 and december31, 2012:real estate credit exposure as of june 30, 2013commercial real

interest is still being accrued.  it is the general policy of the bank to stop accruing interest for all classes of loans past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  in addition, certain restructured loans are placed on nonaccrual status until sufficient evidence of timely payment is obtained.  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period.  amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  there were no financing receivables past due over 90 days accruing interest as of june30, 2013 and december31, 2012. nonperforming loans as of june30, 2013 totaled $19.7 million, or 1.47% of total loans, compared with $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, as of december31, 2012.  the bank aggressively pursues the collection and repayment of all loans. other nonperforming assets, such as repossessed and foreclosed collateral is aggressively liquidated by the bank's collection department.  the total number of loans on

‚Äúsubstandard impaired‚Äù (loans graded 7), "doubtful" (loans graded 7b) or ‚Äúloss‚Äù (loans graded 8) to be individually impaired and may consider ‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù loans (loans graded 6) individually impaired depending on the borrower's payment history.  the bank measures impairment based upon probable cash flows or the value of the collateral.  collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.   updated appraisals are required for all impaired loans and typically at renewal or modification of larger loans if the appraisal is more than 12 months old. impaired loans for all classes of loans typically include nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans and other potential problem loans considered impaired based on other underlying factors.  troubled debt restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition.  interest on troubled debt restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur and a sustained payment performance period is obtained.  due to the borrowers' inability to make the payments required under the original loan terms, the bank modifies the terms by granting a longer amortized repayment structure or reduced interest rates. potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above, but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms.  these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual, past due or troubled debt restructured loans, so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  impaired loans under $250,000 are typically not individually evaluated for impairment.yadkin financial

the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management's best estimate for probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.  the primary risks inherent in the bank's loan portfolio, including the adequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses, are based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these risks, and the related loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by direct charges to provision expense. losses on loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible. recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance for loan losses. the provision for loan losses was $54,696 for the quarter ended june30, 2013 as compared to $2.2 million for the quarter ended june 30, 2012. the provision expense is determined by management  with the use of the bank's allowance for loan losses model. the components of the model are specific reserves for impaired loans and a general allocation for unimpaired loans.  the general allocation has two components, an estimate based on historical loss experience and an additional estimate based on internal and external environmental factors due to the uncertainty of historical loss experience in predicting current embedded losses in the portfolio that will be realized in the future.  the portion of the general allocation on environmental factors includes estimates of losses related to interest rate trends, unemployment trends, real estate characteristics, past due and nonaccrual trends, watch list trends, charge-off trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.   the real estate characteristics component includes trends in real estate concentrations, exceptions to fdic guidelines for loan-to-value ratios, and changes in real estate market values.  other factors impacting the allowance at june30, 2013 were watch list trends, unemployment rate trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.  the following tables present changes in the allowance for loan losses for the three and six months ended june30, 2013 and 2012:yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june

allowance balance for unimpaired loans grouped by loan type.  the company's loan charge-off policy for all loan classes is to charge down loans to net realizable value once a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable, and the underlying collateral shortfall is assessed.  unsecured loans (primarily consumer loans) are charged off against the reserve once the loan becomes 90 days past due or it is determined that a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  secured loans (primarily construction, real estate, commercial and other loans) are moved to nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable and supporting collateral is not considered to be sufficient to cover potential losses.  nonaccrual loans are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if all or a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  nonaccrual loans that are determined to be solely collateral dependent are promptly charged down to net realizable value upon determination that they are impaired.  in addition to the allowance for loan losses, the company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments. unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by loan classification. these classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 28table of contentseconomic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the reserve for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $185,000 and $182,000 as of june30, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the company maintains reserves for mortgage loans sold to agencies and investors in the event that, either through error or disagreement between the parties, the company is required to indemnify the purchase. the reserves take into consideration risks associated with underwriting, key factors in the mortgage industry, loans with specific reserve requirements, past due loans and potential indemnification by the company. reserves are estimated based on consideration of factors in the mortgage industry such as declining collateral values and rising levels of delinquency, default and foreclosure, coupled with increased incidents of quality reviews at all levels of the mortgage industry seeking justification for pushing back losses to loan originators and wholesalers. as of june30, 2013, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $358,590, and charges against reserves for the six months ended june30, 2013 were $83,198 .  there were no charges against reserves for the three months ended june 30, 2013.  for the three months ended june30, 2013, the company recorded $4,990 in negative provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $72 million in loan sales that occurred during the period.  for the six months ended june30, 2013, the company recorded $1.3 million in negative provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $149.6 million in loan sales that occurred during the period due to of the dissolution of the bank's former mortgage subsidiary, sidus financial at the beginning of 2013.   for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012, the company recorded $29,715 and $138,701 in provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure, respectively.  charges against reserves for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012 were $208,539 and $382,092 , respectively.   for the three and six ended june30, 2013 and 2012, the company did not repurchase any mortgage loans sold.  as of december31, 2012, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $1.7 million related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on approximately $9.5 billion in loans sold.11. fair valuethe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. available-for-sale securities, interest rate swaps, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and forward sale loan commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, from time to time, the company may be required to record other assets at fair value, such as loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments usually involve writing the asset down to fair value or the lower of cost or market value. following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. available-for-sale investment securitiesavailable-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, u.s. treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.interest rate swapsinterest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models run by a third-party on a monthly basis.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.   as a result, the company classifies interest rate swaps as level 3.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q

$(480,806), respectively.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the company classifies interest rate lock commitments as level 3.  the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end.  the company classified forward sale commitments as level 2.  there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.the following table presents a rollforward of interest rate lock commitments for the three months ended

rights is performed using a pooling methodology.  similar loans are pooled together and evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings.  the present value of the future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool, calculated by a third party at least semi-annually, using assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing.   as such, the company classifies loan servicing rights as a  level 3 asset. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.the following table presents a rollforward of mortgage servicing rights for the three and six months

of contentsmortgage loans held-for-saleloans held-for-sale are carried at lower of cost or market value. the fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. the changes in fair value of the assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.  as such, the company classifies loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a level 2 asset.  at june30, 2013, the cost of the company's mortgage loans held-for-sale was less than the market value.  accordingly, the company's loans held-for-sale are carried at cost. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june 30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.impaired loansthe company does not record loans held-for-investment at fair value on a recurring basis. however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs), market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. at june30, 2013, the majority of impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral by obtaining third-party appraisals and applying liquidity discounts.  third party appraisals are obtained at least annually for all impaired loans greater than $250,000.  the company records impaired loans as nonrecurring level 3. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.other real estate ownedother real estate owned (‚Äúoreo‚Äù) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to oreo. subsequently, oreo is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs). when the fair value of the collateral is measured due to further deterioration in the value of the oreo since initial recognition, the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level 3. the current carrying value of oreo at june30, 2013 is $3.8 million.  at december 31, 2012 the carrying value of oreo was $8.7 million. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter or six months ended june30, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.the following table presents assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis:june 30, 2013 (in thousands)fair valuelevel 1level

discount rate. a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. the discount rate is determined by the third-party by obtaining third party market quotes from reuters, which handle up to 30 year yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 33table of contentsswap maturities.  the company's asset liability management team periodically reviews the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments to increase if in a gain position, or decrease if in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company's mortgage banking division.the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the company's mortgage servicing rights are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions.  the company utilizes an independent third-party to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through use of a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income based on observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at an estimated fair value. to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the fair value and constant prepayment rates are compared to forward-looking estimates by the company. the following table presents assets

financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 35table of contentsthe fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices, prices quoted for similar instruments, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. for certain categories of loans, such as installment and commercial loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. the cost of fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale approximates the lower of cost or market as these loans are typically sold within 60 days of origination. fair values for adjustable-rate mortgages are based on quoted market prices of similar loans adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  the company applied an additional illiquidity discount in the amount of 10.0%.the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the fhlb stock.the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at june30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts is estimated using the present value of the projected cash flows using rates currently offered for similar deposits with similar maturities.the fair values of borrowings are based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate for debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements. the carrying values of short-term borrowings, including overnight, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and fhlb advances, approximates the fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments. the company's credit risk is not material to calculation of fair value because these borrowings are collateralized. the carrying values of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair values due to the short-term duration.interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.interest rate locks and forward loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing release premium, origination income net of origination costs, and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.13.  business segment informationthe company has two reportable segments, including banking activities and mortgage banking activities.  during the second quarter of 2012, the company changed its reporting of mortgage activities based on the reorganization of the bank's mortgage division.  this decision was made to improve overall reporting of its mortgage banking activities which are now analyzed and reviewed as a separate and distinct business segment.  this change in reporting segment combined both mortgage activities of the bank with mortgage activities that were previously reported separately from mortgage activities provided by sidus.  reclassifications include interest income which was previously presented in other income, commission expenses recorded in salaries that are now recorded as a reduction in mortgage banking activity income, and other miscellaneous expenses previously recorded in other expenses that have been reclassified as a reduction to mortgage banking activity income.  in addition, gains on sale of mortgage loans has been reclassified to be reported with mortgage banking income to provide a combined overview of the mortgage banking activity segment.  the reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.  in the fourth quarter of 2012, a decision was made by management to sell a reinsurance subsidiary held by sidus.  as a result of this decision, sidus reclassified its investment in the reinsurance subsidiary to held for sale and wrote down its investment by $1.0 million to the estimated fair value at december 31, 2012.  the sale of the subsidiary closed in the first quarter of 2013.  in addition, at the beginning of 2013, the company dissolved the sidus subsidiary and is no longer doing business as sidus.   this dissolution resulted in a $1.3 million reduction in reserves on mortgage loans sold in the first quarter of 2013.   all mortgage banking activity beginning in 2013 is at the bank.  the following table details the results of operations for the three and six months ended june30, 2013 and 2012 for bank activities and mortgage activities.

for the quarter.  excluding losses of $49 million sustained in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the accelerated asset disposition plan, the company has recorded $29 million in pre-tax income for eight previous consecutive quarters as credit quality has improved and net interest margin has increased over the past year.     significance:  high‚Ä¢the company is projecting income on a pretax basis, as well as taxable income, for the future periods 2013-2015.  the budgeted provision for loan losses is a key driver of the resulting income.  also, as discussed below, credit quality metrics have significantly improved.  while management believes the 2010, 2011 and 2012 levels of provision are indicative of the worst economic downturn in recent history and will not be repeated, it is important to understand why future losses are not projected at these levels.  in the three year period ended december 31, 2012, management was proactive in charging down collateral dependent loans that are impaired to current market values.   significance:  moderate‚Ä¢in 2012, the company completed a $45 million private placement offering pursuant to which several institutional investors and members of the board and management purchased shares of preferred stock.  in connection with this private placement, the company converted approximately $21 million of its outstanding series t and

a one-for-three reverse stock split of its common stock. in connection with the reverse stock split, every three shares of issued and outstanding company common stock on may 28, 2013 were exchanged for one share of newly issued common stock. fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were exchanged for a cash payment equal to the fraction to which the shareholder would otherwise have been entitled multiplied by the closing price of the company's common stock, as such price is reported on the nasdaq global select market on the last trading day prior to the effectuation of the reverse stock split. other than the number of outstanding shares of common stock disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets, all prior period share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.  articles of amendments - during the second quarter of 2013, the company and the bank amended their respective articles of incorporation to change their names to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively. both of these amendments, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.repurchase of warrants - on june 6, 2013, the u.s. treasury accepted our bid to repurchase the warrant to purchase 128,663 shares of our voting common stock issued to the u.s. treasury pursuant to the tarp capital purchase

the following:‚Ä¢reduced earnings due to higher credit losses generally and specifically because losses in the sectors of our loan portfolio secured by real estate are greater than expected due to economic factors, including declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors;‚Ä¢reduced earnings due to higher credit losses because our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral;‚Ä¢the rate of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off;‚Ä¢the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods;‚Ä¢results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or writedown assets;‚Ä¢the amount of our loan portfolio collateralized by real estate, and the weakness in the commercial real estate market;‚Ä¢our efforts to raise capital or otherwise increase and maintain our regulatory capital ratios above the statutory and agreed upon minimums, including the impact of the capital rules under basel iii;‚Ä¢the impact of our efforts to raise capital on our financial position, liquidity, capital, and profitability;yadkin financial

inflation;‚Ä¢changes in technology;‚Ä¢changes in monetary and tax policies;‚Ä¢ability of borrowers to repay loans, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, natural disasters, which could be exacerbated by potential climate change, and international instability;‚Ä¢changes in deposit flows;‚Ä¢changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines;‚Ä¢changes in the assessment of whether a deferred tax

and international financial markets that have persisted over the past several years, and we are unable to predict what effect these uncertain market conditions will continue to have on us.  there can be no assurance that these unprecedented developments will not continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.we have based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee you that these expectations will be achieved. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.overviewthe following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and six months ended june30, 2013  and 2012 and also analyzes our financial condition as of june30, 2013 as compared to december 31, 2012.  like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments.  our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.  consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.  another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 44table of contentsof course, there are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.  we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings.  in the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.  we describe the various components of this noninterest income, as well as our noninterest expense, in the following discussion.the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements.  we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.the company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or occurrences after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.in 2013, the company executed a one-for-three reverse stock split and an amendment to the company and bank's articles of incorporation changing its name to yadkin financial corporation and yadkin bank, respectively.  both of these events, along with the company's new nasdaq ticker symbol, ydkn, were effective on may 28, 2013.   all references to net income per share and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split.changes in financial positiontotal assets at june30, 2013 were $1,801.9 million, a decrease of $121.5 million, or 6.3%, compared to assets of $1,923.4 million at december 31, 2012.  the loan portfolio, net of allowance for losses, was $1,291.8 million compared to $1,284.4 million at december 31, 2012.  gross loans held-for-investment increased by $5.3 million, or 0.4% as loan production has increased over the past six months.  the allowance for loan losses decreased $2.2 million driven primarily by decreases in classified loans for the six months ended june30, 2013 and decreased charge-offs in 2013 as compared to 2012. total watch list and substandard loans were $88.7 million as compared to $102.9 million as of december 31, 2012, a decrease of $14.2 million.   see note 10 above entitled ‚Äúloans and allowance for loan losses‚Äù for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses.mortgage loans held-for-sale decreased by $5.1 million, or 18.5%, from december 31, 2012 to june30, 2013 as the bank continued its strategy of selling mortgage loans mostly to various investors with servicing rights released and to a lesser extent to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation with servicing rights retained.  this decrease was the result of a smaller pipeline at june30, 2013.  these loans are normally held for a period of two to three weeks before being sold to investors.  mortgage loans closed in the first six months of 2013 ranged from a low of $19.6 million in february 2013 to a high of $30.9 million in january 2013 and totaled $151.4 million for the six months ended june 30, 2013.  mortgage loans closed during the six months ended june 30, 2012 totaled $137.2 million. the securities portfolio decreased from $343.1 million at december 31, 2012, to $330.3 million at june30, 2013, a decrease of $12.8 million due to paydowns and maturities of $56.4 million and sales of $25.6 million in 2013.  the portfolio is comprised of securities of u.s. government agencies (5.0%), mortgage-backed securities (61.5%), state and municipal securities (33.4%), and publicly traded common and preferred stocks (0.1%).  other assets increased $1.6 million due largely to an increase in mortgage servicing rights of $1.3 million, an increase in forward sales commitments of $612,000 and an increase in other prepaid expense of $387,000 offset by a $652,000 reduction in prepaid fdic expense and a $328,000 decrease in other misc assets.  oreo decreased $4.9 million as the result of sales in the amount of $8.2 million, offset by transfers in the amount of $3.3 million for the six months ended june30, 2013.  premises and equipment increased $561,000, or 1.34%.  deferred tax assets also decreased $2.1 million as the company recorded $14.7 million in income before taxes for the year 2013.  see note 14 for detailed information regarding deferred tax assets.deposits decreased $108.6 million, or 6.7%, comparing june30, 2013 to december 31, 2012. overall, noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $21.3 million, or 7.8%, certificates of deposit (‚Äúcods‚Äù) over $100,000 decreased $65.0 million, or 20.6%, and other cods decreased $84.3 million, or 20.2%, while now, savings, and money market accounts increased $62.0 million, or 9.9%, management continues to focus on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand and now accounts through the use of marketing efforts and interest rates.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 45table of contentsborrowed funds decreased $13.2 million, or 12.6%, comparing june30, 2013 to december 31, 2012 as repurchase agreements decreased $13.2 million. long term borrowings included $35.0 million in trust preferred securities and advances from the fhlb of $25.3 million.  the american community merger added $10.4 million in trust preferred securities at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.80% and will mature in 2033.  yadkin valley statutory trust i (‚Äúthe trust‚Äù) issued $25.8 million in trust preferred securities at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 1.32%. the trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, and can be called by the trust without penalty. other liabilities, capital lease obligations and accrued interest payable combined decreased by $3.5 million, or 22.3%, from december 31, 2012 to june30, 2013.  decreases in other liabilities resulted primarily from a $1.7 million decrease in liability related to the sale of the reinsurance subsidiary as well as a $1.3 million reduction in reserves established for sold loans.  in addition, there was a $690,000 decrease in accrued interest payable as average deposits and borrowings have decreased year-over-year. at june30, 2013, total shareholders' equity was $174.6 million, or a book value of $10.17 per common share, compared to $170.8 million, or a book value of $9.93 per common share, at december 31, 2012.  the company's equity to assets ratio was 9.69% and 8.88%, at june30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively.  capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  in order to be considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù, a bank must exceed total risk-based capital ratios of 10%, and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6% and leverage ratios of 5%. in addition, we have committed to regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% to be classified as well-capitalized. our goal has been to maintain a ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù status for the bank since failure to meet or exceed this classification affects how regulatory applications for certain activities, including acquisitions, and continuation and expansion of existing activities, are evaluated and could make our customers and potential investors less confident in our bank. the following table sets forth the company's and the bank's various capital ratios as of june30, 2013 and december 31, 2012.  the company and the bank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios as of june30, 2013, as well as the ratios to be considered "well capitalized."  june 30, 2013december 31, 2012holdingcompanybankholdingcompanybanktotal risk-based capital ratio14.0%13.7%13.3%13.0%tier 1 risk-based capital ratio12.8%12.5%12.2%11.7%leverage ratio10.6%10.3%9.2%8.9%management of equity is a critical aspect of capital management in any business.  the determination of the appropriate amount of equity for a regulated financial institution is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the amount of capital needed to meet regulatory requirements, the amount of ‚Äúrisk equity‚Äù the business requires and balance sheet leverage.in july 2013, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the ‚Äúfederal reserve‚Äù) announced its approval of a final rule to implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, among other changes required by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. the framework requires banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, taking into account the impact of risk. the approved rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as well as a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking institutions. for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations, the rule includes a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance sheet exposures. in terms of quality of capital, the final rule emphasizes common equity tier 1 capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. it also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. the phase-in for smaller banking organizations will not begin until january 2015, while the phase-in period for larger banks starts in january 2014.  the ultimate impact of the u.s. implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed.  yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 46table of contentsto be categorized as well capitalized, the company and the bank each must maintain minimum amounts and ratios.  at june30, 2013, the company is well-capitalized for regulatory purposes both at the bank and holding company level, however the bank has committed to regulators that it will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% which it exceeded at june 30, 2013. liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market riskthe bank derives the majority of its liquidity from its core deposit base and to a lesser extent from wholesale borrowing.  the balance sheet liquidity ratio, measured by the sum of cash (less reserve requirements), investments, and loans held-for-sale reduced by pledged securities, as compared to deposits and short-term borrowings, was 19.0% at june30, 2013 compared to 23.2% at december 31, 2012.  additional liquidity is provided by $119.7 million in unused credit including federal funds purchased lines provided by correspondent banks as well as credit availability from the fhlb. in addition, the bank has unpledged marketable securities of $241.6 million available for use as a source of collateral.  at june30, 2013, brokered deposits totaled $98,680, or 0.01% of total deposits.  brokered certificates of deposit are primarily short-term with maturities of nine months or less.  the bank also maintains a brokered deposit now account to add municipal deposits totaling $1,299 at june30, 2013.  the bank contracted with promontory interfinancial network ("promontory") in 2008 for various services including wholesale cod funding. promontory's cdars¬Æ product, one-way buysm, enables the bank to bid on a weekly basis through a private auction for cod terms ranging from four weeks to 260weeks (approximately five years) with settlement available each thursday.  there were no outstanding funds acquired through the one-way buy product at june30, 2013 or december 31, 2012. promontory also provides a product, cdars¬Æ reciprocal, which allows the bank's customers to place funds in excess of the fdic insurance limit with promontory's network of participating banks so that the customer is fully insured for the amount deposited. promontory provides reciprocating funds to the bank from funds placed at other banks by their customers. the bank sets its customers' interest rates when they place deposits through the network and pays/receives the rate difference to/from the other banks whose reciprocal funds are held by the bank. the overall impact of this process is that the bank effectively pays the rate offered to its relationship customer. therefore, the bank does not consider these funds to be wholesale or brokered funds. in compliance with fdic reporting requirements, the bank includes reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits in its quarterly federal financial institutions examination council call report.  cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits totaled $166,000 at june 30, 2013 and $165,000 at december 31, 2012.management continues to assess interest rate risk internally and by utilizing outside sources.  the balance sheet is asset sensitive over a three-month period, meaning that there will be more assets than liabilities immediately repricing as market rates change. over a period of twelve months, the balance sheet remains slightly asset sensitive. we generally would benefit from increasing market interest rates when we have an asset-sensitive, or a positive interest rate gap, and we would generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we have liability-sensitive, or a negative interest rate gap.  the company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.  the company's exposure to market risk is reviewed regularly by management.results of operationsnet income for the quarter ended june30, 2013 was $4.8 million before preferred dividends, compared to net income of $11.0 million in the same period of 2012.  net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended june30, 2013 was $4.2 million.   net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended june30, 2012 was $10.2 million.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.30 for the three month period ended june30, 2013.  basic and diluted income per common share were $1.57 for the three month period ended june30, 2012.  on an annualized basis, first quarter results represent a return on average assets of 0.93% at june30, 2013 compared to 2.08% at june30, 2012, and a return on average equity of 9.63% compared to 26.93% at june30, 2012.   net income for the six month period ended june 30, 2013 was $9.5 million before preferred dividends, compared to net income of $14.5 million in the same period of 2012.  net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended june 30, 2013 was $8.4 million, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $12.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2012.  basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.59 for the six months ended june 30, 2013.  basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.98 for the six months ended june 30, 2012.  on an annualized basis, year-to-date results yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 47table of contentsrepresent a return on average assets of 0.92% at june 30, 2013 compared to 1.31% at june 30, 2012, and a return on average equity of 9.78% compared to 16.64% at june 30, 2012.  prior year net income included a reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which resulted in an income tax benefit of $9.4 million for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012.net interest incomenet interest income, the largest contributor to earnings, increased $963,000, or 6.4%, to $16.1 million in the second quarter of 2013, compared with $15.2 million in the same period of 2012.  the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 48.4% as average interest bearing deposits are down 12% from the prior year and deposit costs are declining as time deposits continue to reprice at lower rates.   the net interest margin increased to 3.90% in the second quarter of 2013 from 3.39% in the second quarter of 2012.    the increase in net interest margin is primarily related to a decrease in deposit yields and borrowings cost.  deposit yields have decreased as management focused efforts on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing now and money market accounts.   the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of changing rates on net interest income.  net interest income for the six months ended june 30, 2013 increased to $31.2 million from $31.1 million when compared to the same period in 2012.  the net interest margin increased to 3.73% in the first six months of 2013 from 3.46% in the first six months of 2012.   the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of

the bank is a significant estimate that is based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses was $22.9 million at june30, 2013, or 1.74% of loans held-for-investment, as compared to $25.1 million, or 1.92% of loans held-for-investment, at december31, 2012.  decreases in the allowance for loan losses were due to decreased charge-offs and decreased criticized loans in the first half of 2013.  decreases in criticized loans were due to improvements in loans 30-89 days past due, payoffs and overall improvements in underlying credit exposures.   the allowance model is applied to the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for performing loans grouped by loan type.  out of the $22.9 million in total allowance for loan losses at june30, 2013, the specific allowance for impaired loans accounted for $2.0 million, up from $1.4 million at year end as two new relationships were added to nonaccrual status during the first quarter and additional reserves were needed.  see discussion below in "nonperforming assets" for further discussion of nonaccrual relationships.  the remaining general allowance, $20.9 million, was attributed to performing loans and was down from $23.7 million at year end.  the general allowance, as a percent of loans not individually reviewed for impairment was 1.63% as of june30, 2013 as compared to 1.86% as of december31, 2012.  the decrease in the general allowance was driven primarily by a decrease in charge-offs, as well as a decrease in substandard and watch loans of $14.2 million which resulted from a few significant payoffs and improvements in past dues and underlying credit exposures of previously classified loans.  there were decreased provisions in many of the loan types including negative provisions for the six months ended june 30, 2013 for owner-occupied and non owner-occupied commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential, multifamily and home equity lines of credit as charge-offs, nonaccruals and classified loans in these categories decreased.beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the company changed its method of calculating the historical loss experience to incorporate  a methodology that takes into consideration the probability of loss for each loan type and credit quality, and historical losses given default.  this process not only helps break out loans by risk, but also looks at the migration of the credit quality over a period of two years.  the impact of this change to the allowance for loan losses was an increase of $1.4 million in the general reserve allocation.net loan charge offs were $1.6 million, or 0.49% (annualized), of average loans, for the three months ended june30, 2013 compared to $3.5 million, or 0.99% (annualized), of average loans for the three months ended june 30, 2012.  decrease in charge-offs is related to a significant decrease in problem loans over the past 12 months.  charge-offs over the past three years have been elevated due to declines in real estate values and overall economic conditions.   for the six months ended june 30, 2013, net loan charge offs were $2.5 million, or 0.38% (annualized) of average loans compared to $8.6 million, or 1.22% (annualized) of average loans, for the six months ended june 30, 2012.management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the bank's loan portfolio as of june30, 2013. no assurance can be given in this regard, however, especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in the bank's market areas. management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and will consider future changes to the allowance that may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions.  additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the bank's allowance for loan losses.  such agencies may require the yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 49table of contentsrecognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses. the downturn experienced in the real estate market from 2008 through 2011 resulted in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures.  in some cases, that downturn resulted in significant impairments to the value of collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.  management aggressively monitors its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with significant weaknesses.  the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. if real estate values begin to decline in the future, it is more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and our net charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. assurances cannot be made either (1) that further charges to the allowance account will not be significant in relation to the normal activity or (2) that further evaluation of the loan portfolio based on prevailing conditions may not require sizable additions to the allowance and charges to provision expense. our real estate portfolio has approximately $127.6 million of construction loans, $570.9 million of commercial real estate loans, $167.8 million in first lien mortgage loans, $195.6 million in home equity lines of credit and $33.7 million in multifamily mortgage loans as of june30, 2013. we consider our construction and junior lien mortgage loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio.  construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed into properties such as sub-divisions or speculative houses. normally, these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the developed property.  in addition, management continues to evaluate closely junior lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.  given the slow economic recovery, and real estate values that have been slow to recover, the company recognizes that it may experience some loss in these portfolios, and management continues to monitor borrower financials,  ltvs, and first lien positions.   the significance of both construction and commercial real estate loans to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due.   loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and commercial real estate loans were $1.2 million and $353,000, respectively, for the six months ended june 30, 2013.  for the six months ended june 30, 2012, net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and commercial real estate loans were $3.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.   as of june30, 2013, $5.4 million of our real estate loans had interest reserves including both borrower and bank funded, compared to $9.8 million as of december 31, 2012.  there is a risk that an interest reserve could mask problems with a borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt consistent with the terms and conditions of the loan obligation, therefore the company has implemented review policies and internal controls to identify and monitor all loans with interest reserves.  nonperforming assetstotal nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due but still accruing, and foreclosed real estate) decreased from $31.6 million at december 31, 2012 to $23.5 million at june30, 2013.  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.30% as of june30, 2013 as compared to 1.64% as of december 31, 2012, due primarily to a decrease in foreclosed real estate since december 31, 2012 as the company sold over $5 million in foreclosed properties in a recent auction.  total nonaccrual loans decreased from $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, at december 31, 2012 to $19.7 million, or 1.47% of total loans, at june30, 2013.  we have analyzed our nonperforming loans to determine what we believe is the amount needed to reserve in the allowance for loan losses based on an assessment of the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan.   we have downgraded loans for which the probability of collection is uncertain and written down oreo property values where net realizable values have declined.  specific allowance for nonperforming loans accounted for $2.0 million, up from $1.4 million at year end, due to the addition of two relationships for which additional reserves were required at june 30, 2013.approximately 45% of loans in nonaccrual status are currently not past due 30 days or more. the total number of loans on nonaccrual has decreased from 315 to 195 since december 31, 2012. the average nonaccrual loan balance is $101,000 and $71,000 as of june30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. at june30, 2013, 84% of the nonaccrual loans were secured by  real estate.the largest amount of nonaccrual loans for one customer relationship totaled $3.4 million. this relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase and refinance of real estate, acquisition of equipment and related operating expenses. this relationship currently has a reserve of $954,453 assigned to it as of june 30, 2013. nonaccrual loans also include two other large relationships each totaling $1.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively as of june 30, 2013. the first of these nonaccrual relationships consists of one loan that was originally used for working capital purposes and is secured by real yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 50table of contentsestate, account receivables, inventory and equipment. this loan currently has a reserve of $87,939 assigned to it as of june 30, 2013. the second relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase of two businesses and secured by the real estate. this relationship does not have any specific reserve assigned to it as of june 30, 2013. all of these loans have been placed in nonaccrual status because of concerns for the customers' continued ability to pay, collateral deterioration and depressed future industry outlook.noninterest incomenoninterest income consists of all revenues that are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets.  total noninterest income increased approximately $1.8 million, or 40.4%, comparing the second quarters of 2013 and 2012.   this increase was primarily related to an increase in mortgage banking income of $872,000, or 52.1% which resulted primarily from an increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights.  other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $8,000, or 0.6%, due primarily to a $88,000 decrease in nsf and odp charges.  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in service charges on business checking accounts of $58,000 and an increase in service charges on now and money market accounts of $21,000.‚Ä¢other service fees increased $508,000 when comparing the second quarter of 2013 to the prior year due primarily to an increase of $478,000 in commissions and fees on annuity and mutual fund sales and investment service fee income.   increase in investment service fees and commissions was due to an increase in investment activity in 2013.  atm and debit card fee income also increased $25,000 as compared to the second quarter of 2012.  ‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities decreased $28,000 as fewer investments were sold in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 2012.‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by $7,000, or 4.5%, during the three month period ended june30, 2013.‚Ä¢mortgage banking income increased approximately $872,000 for the second quarter of 2013 as servicing income including fair market value adjustments for mortgage servicing rights increased $950,000 from the prior year due to an increase in mortgage loans serviced from $264 million in june 2012 to $376 million in june 2013.‚Ä¢other income increased by approximately $441,000, or 773.7%, for the second quarter of 2013.  this increase is primarily due to the reversal of contingency reserve accounts established for the derisk transactions in the amount of $372,000.for the six months ended june 30, 2013, total noninterest income increased approximately $3.9 million, or 49.6%, as compared to the six months ended june 30, 2012.  an increase in the mortgage banking activities of $3.0 million made up the majority of the increase, due primarily to $1.3 million in negative provisions recorded related to reserves on sold loans and an increase in the fair value  of mortgage servicing rights of $939,000.  other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts increased $18,000, or 0.7%, as service charges on business checking accounts (a major component of service charges) increased $95,000 and service charges on money market and now accounts increased $18,000.   these increases were partially offset by a decrease in nsf (including overdraft privilege) of $96,000.‚Ä¢the increase in other service fees of $539,000 was due primarily to an increase in investment service fees and commissions of $561,000 as investment activity has increased in 2013.‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities decreased $24,000, or 8.0% due to decreased sales activity during the six months ended june 30, 2013 as compared to 2012.‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by 3.5% during the six months ended june 30, 2013.‚Ä¢mortgage banking activities increased approximately $3.0 million, or 107.4% for the six months ended june 30, 2013 as $1.3 million in negative provisions were recorded related to reserves on sold loans and the fair value of yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 51table of contentsservicing rights increased $939,000 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in mortgage loans serviced from $264 million in june 2012 to $376 million in june 2013.‚Ä¢other income, including gains on sale of loans, increased by approximately $421,000, or 318.9%, year-to-date primarily due to the reversal of contingency reserve accounts established for the derisk transactions in the amount of $372,000.noninterest expensetotal noninterest expenses were $14.8 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $15.7 million in the same period of 2012, a decrease of $889,000, or 5.7%.   noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and all other operating costs.  noninterest expense to average assets for the quarter ended june30, 2013 and 2012 was 0.82%, and 0.80%, respectively.  noninterest expense to average assets for the six months ended june30, 2013 and 2012 was 1.52%, and 1.49%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the three months ended june30, 2013 and 2012 were 66.55% and 65.63%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the six months ended june30, 2013 and 2012 were 66.53% and 72.73%, respectively.  the efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expenses less amortization of intangibles and gains on sale of other real estate owned to the total of the taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income.  the following is a summary of the fluctuations for the quarter  and six months ended june30, 2013 as compared to june30, 2012:‚Ä¢quarter-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 25.2%.  the major components of this increase are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased $485,000 due to the addition of several new managerial positions across the company since june 2012, as well as annual increases.  incentive compensation also increased $813,000 as the company began accruing for a new company wide incentive program for all employees in 2013.  other increases include a $210,000 increase in commissions and a $46,000 increase in 401(k) expense.‚Ä¢year-to-date, salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 23.1%.  the major components of this increase are summarized as follows: salaries and wages increased by $898,000 due to personnel additions and annual increases. related payroll taxes also increased $179,000, and 401(k) expense also increased $183,000.    commission expenses increased by $250,000 and incentive compensation increased $1.4 million due to the new incentive program noted above.‚Ä¢occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $161,000, or 9.0%,  for the quarter and $124,000, or 3.4%, for the six months ended june 30, 2013 due to an increase in software and equipment maintenance costs.  ‚Ä¢advertising and marketing expense increased by $333,000, or 333.0%, comparing the second quarter 2013 with the second quarter 2012.  year-to-date advertising and marketing expense increased by $513,000, or 291.5%.  the increases are the direct result of a rebranding project announced in early 2013, including a company and bank name change.‚Ä¢data processing expense decreased $103,000, or 22.7%, for the quarter and $96,000, or 11.4% year-to-date due to the implementation of live branch capture in 2013 which reduced daily courier service costs and provides additional efficiencies.  ‚Ä¢communication expense decreased $16,000, or 4.5%, for the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012.  year-to-date communications expense decreased $35,000, or 5.0%.  decreases in communications expense is due to efforts made to decrease overall costs.‚Ä¢fdic assessment expenses decreased $17,000 for the quarter and $120,000 year-to-date, as deposits have decreased 9% since the second quarter of 2012.   ‚Ä¢net cost of operation of other real estate owned decreased $2.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2012 as the company recorded $272,000 in gains on sales for the quarter ended june 30, 2013 which resulted from a recent auction of foreclosed properties as compared to $2.4 million in writedowns recorded in the second quarter of 2012.     net cost of operation of other real estate owned decreased $5.0 million for the six months ended june 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year.  $1.2 million in gains on sales were recorded in 2013 as the turnout and sales from the auction announced in late 2012 were higher than  anticipated.  in the prior year, the company recorded losses on sales and writedowns of $3.2 million for the six months ended june 30, 2012.yadkin financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report june 30, 2013 52table of contents‚Ä¢loan collection fees decreased $3,000, or 1.5%, compared to the second quarter of 2012  and decreased $23,000, or 5.2%, year-to-date as past dues and classified loans have decreased significantly since the prior year.  ‚Ä¢other professional fees increased $18,000 for the quarter and $189,000 year-to-date when compared to the prior year due to increased accruals for internal audit services performed by a third party and external credit risk review.  the additional accruals are for anticipated higher costs as well as the timing of accruals as compared to the prior year.‚Ä¢quarter-to-date other operating expenses increased by $157,000, or 6.8%.   other expenses in 2013 includes additional expenses accrued for the recently announced corporate rebranding and name change in the amount of $212,000.   other increases include a $166,000 increase in transfer agent fees related to the recent 1-for-3 reverse stock split; and a $98,000 increase in software related expenses.  accounting expenses also increased $29,000 due to the projects noted above.   offsetting these increases was a decrease in training expense of $298,000 as prior year expenses included a company wide training initiative.‚Ä¢year-to-date other operating expenses increased approximately $464,000 or 10.5%.  increases include a $222,000  increase in transfer agent fees related to the recent 1-for-3 reverse stock split and additional

in audit and accounting fees, and a $189,000 increase in software related expenses.  in addition, approximately $97,000 in third party fees were incurred related to recent projects including the capital raise, loan sale and oreo auction.    these increases were offset by a decrease in training expense of $426,000 as the company embarked on a training program for all employees in 2012 and a $97,000 decrease in attorney fees.income tax expensethe company recorded income tax expense for the three and six months ended june30, 2013 of $2.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively . the company recorded an income tax benefit for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012 of $9.4 million, as the valuation allowance for deferred taxes was reversed in the second quarter of 2012.  the reversal of the allowance was based primarily on a return to profitability as the company has reported four consecutive quarters of net income, projected net income over the next 12 months and improving credit quality metrics.   the effective tax rate for the three months ended june30, 2013 was 35.1%  as compared to 100.2% for the three months ended june30, 2012, excluding the reversal of allowance.   the effective tax rate for the six months ended june 30, 2013 was 35.5% as compared to 31.8% for the six months ended june 30, 2012, excluding the reversal of allowance.  see footnote 14 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense and deferred tax assets.  item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskmarket risk is the risk of

2013 6table of contentsnotes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements1.  significant accounting policiesbasis of presentationthe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of yadkin valley financial corporation  (the "company") and its subsidiary, yadkin valley bank and trust company (the "bank").  on july 1, 2006, the bank became a subsidiary of the company through a one for one share exchange of the then outstanding 10,648,300 shares.  the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial statements and with instructions to form 10-q and regulation s-x.  accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (‚Äúgaap‚Äù) for complete financial statements.  because the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included with the company's 2012 annual report on form 10-k (the "2012 form 10-k") filed with the securities and exchange commission (‚Äúsec‚Äù) on february 28, 2013.  operating results, for the three months ended march 31, 2013, do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the year or other interim periods.in the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments, all of which are normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of march 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three months ended march 31, 2013 and 2012.  the accounting policies followed are set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the company's 2012 form 10-k.mortgage banking activities -    during the first quarter of 2013, sidus financial, llc ("sidus"), a subsidiary of the bank, was dissolved.  as a result of the dissolution, the company's mortgage activities are now reported based on the reorganization of the bank's mortgage division.   this decision was made to improve overall reporting of its mortgage banking activities which are now combined and analyzed as a separate and distinct business segment.  this change in reporting segment combines both mortgage activities of the bank with mortgage activities that were previously reported separately from mortgage activities provided by sidus.  mortgage banking activity income includes gains on sale of mortgage loans made with the intent to sell, revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments, direct costs related to the gain of mortgage loans, and costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans.  also included in mortgage banking activity income is all servicing income earned in connection with servicing activities and mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments.   when the bank retains the right to service a sold mortgage loan, the previous carrying amount is allocated between the loan sold and the retained mortgage servicing right based on their relative fair values on the date of transfer.  the bank uses the fair value method of accounting for mortgage servicing rights.  servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets.   reclassifications - certain income and expenses reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation of mortgage banking activity income.  reclassifications include interest income which was previously presented in other income, commission expenses recorded in salaries that are now recorded as a reduction in mortgage banking activity income, and other miscellaneous expenses previously recorded in other expenses that have been reclassified as a reduction to mortgage banking activity income.  in addition, gains on sale of mortgage loans has been reclassified to be reported with mortgage banking income to provide a combined overview of the mortgage banking activity segment.  the reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.2. new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardsin february 2013, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2013-02, "reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income" ("asu 2013-02"). this guidance is the culmination of the fasb's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci").  the amendments in asu 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. however, the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 7table of contentsafter december 15, 2012.  the company has adopted the standard and the adoption of asu 2013-02 did not have an impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows but did result in additional disclosures in footnote 15.3.   stock-based compensationduring the three months ended march31, 2013,

options granted during the first three months ended march 31, 2012.   there were no options exercised for the three months ended march 31, 2013 or 2012.as of march31, 2013, there are 623,782

or permitted by law.the following table presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of investment securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012. securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at march31, 2013 include one collateralized mortgage obligation and one private label collateralized mortgage obligation.  the key factors considered in evaluating the collateralized yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 10table of contentsmortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, and municipal securities were cash flows of the investment and the assessment of other relative economic factors.  securities that have been in a loss position for twelve months or more at december31, 2012 include three collateralized mortgage obligations, one private label collateralized mortgage obligation and two other securities.   the unrealized losses relate to securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to a shift in demand from non-governmental securities and municipals to u.s. treasury bonds and governmental agencies due to credit market concerns. the unrealized losses are not likely to reverse until market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. none of the unrealized losses relate to the marketability of the securities or the issuer's ability to honor redemption obligations.  it is not more likely than not that the company will have to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. for the three months ended march31, 2013, there were no securities available-for-sale deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (‚Äúotti‚Äù).   if management determines that an investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment, the loss is

equity securitiesthe aggregate cost of the company's cost method investments totaled $4,902,828 at march31, 2013 and $6,706,012 at december31, 2012.  cost method investments at march31, 2013 include $3,474,300 in federal home loan bank ("fhlb") stock and $1,428,528 of investments in various trust and financial companies, which are included in other assets.  all cost method investments were evaluated for impairment at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012.  the following factors have been considered in determining the carrying amount of fhlb stock: 1) the recoverability of the par value, 2) the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all operational needs in the foreseeable future and would not need to dispose of the stock below recorded amounts, 3) redemptions and purchases of the stock are at the discretion of the fhlb, 4) the company believes the fhlb has the ability to absorb economic losses given the expectation that the various fhlbs' have a high degree of government support, and 5) the unrealized losses related to securities owned by the fhlb are manageable given the capital levels of the organization.   during the three months ended march31, 2013, the company's investment in a financial services company was considered to be other than temporarily impaired and approximately $39,185 was charged-off.    there were no other than temporary impairments recorded for the three months ended march 31, 2012.6.  commitments and contingenciesin the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  at march31, 2013, the company had commitments outstanding of $299.2 million  for additional loan amounts.  commitments of the bank's mortgage lending department are excluded from this amount and discussed in the paragraph below.  additional commitments totaling $7.1 million were outstanding under standby letters of credit.  management does not expect any significant losses to result from these commitments. at march31, 2013, the bank had $42.6 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $60.9 million of forward commitments outstanding under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  see note 9 for additional disclosures on these derivative financial instruments.7.    earnings per common sharebasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting periods.  diluted net income available to common shareholders per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  the numerators of the basic net income per common share computations are the same as the numerators of the diluted net income per common share computations for all the periods presented.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended march31, 2013 excludes 527,620 shares of unvested restricted stock.  weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended march 31, 2012 excludes 119,669 shares of unvested restricted stock.  a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computations to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computations is as follows:three months endedmarch 31,20132012basic

254,667 warrants and stock options that were not considered dilutive because the exercise prices exceeded the average market price per share and 561,590 shares of restricted stock not considered dilutive because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method or because performance and service criteria had not been met.   during the quarter ended march 31, 2012 there were 265,694 warrants and stock options that were not considered dilutive. the non-dilutive options had exercise prices ranging from $3.04 to $19.07 per share.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q

bank, as a north carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends if such distributions will not reduce its capital below its applicable ‚Äúrequired capital.‚Äù the bank's ‚Äúrequired capital‚Äù is that amount of capital required for the bank to be deemed ‚Äúadequately capitalized‚Äù under applicable federal regulatory capital ratios.  currently, the bank exceeds each of these federal regulatory capital ratios. however, the bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends to the holding company without prior approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation (the ‚Äúfdic‚Äù) and the north carolina banking commissioner. in addition, the company has committed to the regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00% to be classified as well-capitalized.   the company's tier 1 leverage ratio is 10.0% at march 13, 2013 and exceeds committed levels.9.  derivativesthe company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.for derivatives that are economic hedges, but are not designated as hedging instruments or otherwise do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income during the period of change.as part of interest rate risk management, the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert certain fixed-rate receivables to floating rates and certain fixed-rate obligations to floating rates.the interest rate swaps are used to provide fixed rate financing while managing interest rate risk and were not designated as hedges.  the interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month libor, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. the interest rate swaps are settled quarterly and mature on june 15, 2016.   the interest rate swaps each had a notional amount of $1.9 million at march31, 2013, representing the amount of fixed-rate receivables outstanding and liabilities outstanding, and are included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair value of $179,612.   the company had a gain of $16,395 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $16,395 on the interest rate swap liability for the three months ended march31, 2013.   the company had a gain of $7,903 on the interest rate swap asset and a loss of $7,903 on the interest rate swap liability for the three months ended march31, 2012.  the interest rate swaps had a notional amount of $2.0 million outstanding as of december31, 2012 and was included in other assets and other liabilities at their fair market value of $196,006.  all changes in fair value are recorded as other income within non-interest income.  fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts.the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing mortgage origination business. the bank's mortgage banking segment enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.  the primary risks managed by derivative instruments are these interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments.  interest rate lock commitments are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed rate loan commitments.  the period of time between the issuance of a loan commitment and the closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 10 to 60days. such interest rate lock commitments and forward-loan-sale commitments represent derivative instruments which are required to be carried at fair value. these derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of the company's interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the balance sheet in other assets and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.  the fair value of the company's forward sales commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities and on the income statement in mortgage banking income.at march31, 2013, the bank had $42.6 million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans held-for-sale at fixed prices and $60.9 million of forward commitments outstanding for original commitments and outstanding mortgage loans held-for-sale under best efforts contracts to sell mortgages to agencies and other investors.  the fair value of forward sales commitments recorded in other liabilities was $425,220 at march31, 2013.  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments recorded in assets was $806,913 at march31, 2013.  recognition of gains related to the change in fair value of forward sales commitments were $55,586 for the three months ended march31, 2013, and are included in mortgage banking activities income. recognition of losses related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments were $66,151 for the three months ended march31, 2013 and are included in mortgage banking activities income.  recognition of losses related to the change in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and gains related to forward sales commitments were $13,492 and $4,629 for the three months ended march31, 2012, respectively, and are included in other income.  at december31, 2012, the bank had $46.7 million of yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 13table of contentscommitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans

for loan lossesgeneral.  the bank provides to its customers a full range of short- to medium-term commercial, agricultural, small business administration guaranteed, mortgage, home equity, and personal loans, both secured and unsecured.  the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans.  the following table presents loans at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012 by class:march

loans, home equity lines of credit, and residential mortgages.  commercial real estate loans totaled $562.4 million and $554.5 million at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  this lending has involved loans secured by owner-occupied commercial buildings for office, storage and warehouse space, as well as non-owner occupied commercial buildings. the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt.  loans secured by commercial real estate may be larger in size and may involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties.construction/development lending totaled $133.2 million and $132.0 million at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the bank originates one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower) and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre-sold homes.  the bank generally receives a pre-arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre-sold homes; however, the bank also engages in selected speculative housing lending to existing builder clients utilizing lots that the bank has a collateral interest in.  the bank also makes commercial real estate construction loans, primarily for owner-occupied properties.  the bank limits its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures.  residential one-to-four family loans amounted to $166.6 million and $168.6 million at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively. the bank's residential mortgage loans are typically construction loans that convert into permanent financing and are secured by properties located within the bank's market areas.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 14table of contentshome equity lines of credit totaled $193.4 million and $191.9 million at march 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively.  the bank's home equity lines of credit generally are variable rate lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties.commercial loans.  at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, the bank's commercial loan portfolio totaled $163.3 million and $174.4 million, respectively. commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital, expansion, and other business purposes.  short-term working capital loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment.  the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate.  lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength, cash flow, management and credit history of the borrower, and the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  with few exceptions, the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment.  commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans.  consumer loans.  loans to individuals (consumer loans) include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans and totaled $49.9 million and $51.7 million at march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans, even if secured, if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, and equipment.  repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan.  consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss, illness and other personal factors.  the bank manages the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss.loan approvals.  the bank's loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations.  the guidelines address the type of loans that the bank seeks, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations.  all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations.  these limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness to the bank, including any indebtedness as a guarantor. the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the bank.  the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by independent, outside professionals experienced in loan review.  responsibility for loan review, loan underwriting, and approval resides with the chief credit officer position. on an annual basis, the board of directors of the bank determines officers lending authority.  authorities may include loans, letters of credit, overdrafts, uncollected funds and such other authorities as determined by the board of directors.substantially all of the company's loans have been granted to customers in the piedmont, foothills, northwestern mountains, and the research triangle regions of north carolina and the upstate region of south carolina.credit review and evaluation.  the bank has a credit review department that reports to the chief credit officer.  the focus of the department is on policy compliance and proper grading of higher credit risk loans as well as new and existing loans on a sample basis. additional reporting for problem/criticized assets has been developed along with an after-the-fact loan review.  a newly expanded enterprise risk management role also performs ongoing credit review and  evaluation  to help manage and assess overall credit risk for the company.the bank uses a risk grading program to facilitate the evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for real estate, commercial and consumer loans.  in this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers, reviewed by regional credit officers, and further reviewed by internal credit review analysts on a test basis.  the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank's market area.  every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies.  loans over $20,000 are risk graded on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 8 (loss).  acceptable loans at inception are grades 1 through 4, and these grades have underwriting requirements that at least meet the minimum requirements of a secondary market source.  if borrowers do not meet credit history requirements, other mitigating criteria such as substantial liquidity and low loan-to-value ratios could be considered and would generally have to be met in order to make the loan.  the bank's loan policy states that a guarantor may be necessary if reasonable doubt exists as to the borrower's ability to repay.  the board of directors has authorized the loan officers to have individual approval authority for risk grade 1 through 4 loans up to maximum exposure limits for each customer.  new or renewed loans that are graded 5 (special mention) or lower must have approval from a regional credit officer. any changes in risk assessments as determined by loan officers, credit administrators, regulatory examiners and management are also considered.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 15table of contentsthe risk grades, normally assigned by the loan officers when the loan is originated and reviewed by the regional credit officers, are based on several factors including historical data, current economic factors, composition of the portfolio, and evaluations of the total loan portfolio and assessments of credit quality within specific loan types.  in some cases, the risk grades are assigned by regional executives, depending upon dollar exposure.  because these factors are dynamic, the provision for loan losses can fluctuate.  credit quality reviews are based primarily on analysis of borrowers' cash flows, with asset values considered only as a second source of payment.   regional credit officers work with lenders in underwriting, structuring and risk grading the bank's credits.  the risk review officer focuses on lending policy compliance, credit risk grading, and credit risk reviews on larger dollar exposures.  management uses the information developed from the procedures above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio.  this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses.the following is a summary of the credit risk grade definitions for all loan types:‚Äú1‚Äù - high quality-  these loans represent a credit extension of the highest quality.  the borrower's historic (at least five years) cash flows manifest extremely large and stable margins of coverage.  balance sheets are conservative, well capitalized, and liquid.  after considering debt service for proposed and existing debt, projected cash flows continue to be strong and provide ample coverage. the borrower typically reflects broad geographic and product diversification and has access to alternative financial markets.  ‚Äú2‚Äù - good quality-  these loans have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment.  the borrower may have access to alternative sources of financing, but sources are not as widely available as they are to a higher graded borrower.  this loan carries a normal level of risk, with minimal loss exposure.  the borrower has the ability to perform according to the terms of the credit facility. the margins of cash flow coverage are satisfactory but vulnerable to more rapid deterioration than the highest quality loans.  ‚Äú3‚Äù - satisfactory-  the borrowers are a reasonable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations.  risk factors may include reliability of margins and cash flows, liquidity, dependence on a single product or industry, cyclical trends, depth of management, or limited access to alternative financing sources.  historic financial information may indicate erratic performance, but current trends are positive.  quality of financial information is adequate, but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher graded loans.  if adverse circumstances arise, the impact on the borrower may be significant. ‚Äú4‚Äù - satisfactory - merits attention-  these credit facilities have potential developing weaknesses that deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel.  if the developing weakness is not corrected or mitigated, there may be deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the bank's debt in the future.  ‚Äú5‚Äù - watch  or special mention -   these loans are typically existing loans, made using the passing grades outlined above, that have deteriorated to the point that cash flow is not consistently adequate to meet debt service or current debt service coverage is based on projections.  secondary sources of repayment may include specialized collateral or real estate that is not readily marketable or undeveloped, making timely collection in doubt. ‚Äú6‚Äù - substandard-  loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade are considered inadequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral.  these obligations, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have well-defined weaknesses related to adverse financial, managerial, economic, market, or political conditions jeopardizing repayment of principal and interest as originally intended.  clear loss potential, however, does not have to exist in any individual assets classified as substandard.‚Äú7‚Äù - substandard impaired (also includes any loans over 90 days past due, excluding sold mortgages )-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú6,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  "7b"-  doubtful-  loans and other credit extensions graded ‚Äú7b‚Äù have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded ‚Äú7,‚Äù with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  the probability of some loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined.  such pending factors could include merger or liquidation, additional capital injection, refinancing plans, or perfection of liens on additional collateral.  loans in this yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 16table of contentsclassification are placed in non-accrual status, with collections applied to principal on the bank's books and evaluated for impairment.  all loans in this category are considered impaired and all material loans are evaluated for a specific reserve in accordance with fas 114 and the bank's alll methodology and specific reserve guidelines.‚Äú8‚Äù - loss-  loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of the bank.  such loans are to be charged-off or charged-down.  this classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but that it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.the following is a summary of credit quality indicators by class at march31, 2013 and december31,

include loans classified as nonaccrual, foreclosed bank-owned property and loans past due 90 days or more on which interest is still being accrued.  it is the general policy of the bank to stop accruing interest for all classes of loans past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  in addition, certain restructured loans are placed on nonaccrual status until sufficient evidence of timely payment is obtained.  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period.  amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  there were no financing receivables past due over 90 days accruing interest as of march31, 2013 and december31, 2012. nonperforming loans as of march31, 2013 totaled $23.7 million, or 1.79% of total loans, compared with $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, as of december31, 2012.  the bank aggressively pursues the collection and repayment of all loans. other nonperforming assets, such as repossessed and foreclosed collateral is aggressively liquidated by the bank's collection department.  the total number of loans on nonaccrual status has decreased from 315 at december31, 2012 to 207 at march31, 2013. yadkin

(loans graded 7b) or ‚Äúloss‚Äù (loans graded 8) to be individually impaired and may consider ‚Äúsubstandard‚Äù loans (loans graded 6) individually impaired depending on the borrower's payment history.  the bank measures impairment based upon probable cash flows or the value of the collateral.  collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.   updated appraisals are required for all impaired loans and typically at renewal or modification of larger loans if the appraisal is more than 12 months old. impaired loans for all classes of loans typically include nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans and other potential problem loans considered impaired based on other underlying factors.  troubled debt restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition.  interest on troubled debt restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur and a sustained payment performance period is obtained.  due to the borrowers' inability to make the payments required under the original loan terms, the bank modifies the terms by granting a longer amortized repayment structure or reduced interest rates. potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above, but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms.  these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual, past due or troubled debt restructured loans, so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  impaired loans under $250,000 are typically not individually evaluated for impairment.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013

contentsimpaired loans acquired in business combinations without a related allowance for loan losses includes loans for which no additional reserves have been recorded in excess of credit discounts for purchased impaired loans.  impaired loans acquired with subsequent deterioration and related allowance for loan losses are loans in which additional impairment has been identified in excess of credit discounts resulting in additional reserves.  these additional reserves are included in the allowance for loan losses related to purchased impaired loans and were $6,579 and $6,672 as of march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  at march31, 2013, the outstanding balance of purchased impaired loans from american community bancshares, inc. ("american community"), which includes principal, interest and fees due, was $93,890.  because of the uncertainty of the expected cash flows, the company is accounting for each purchased impaired loan under the cost recovery method, in which all cash payments are applied to principal.  thus, there is no accretable yield associated with the above loans.  troubled debt restructured loans.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans outstanding as of march31, 2013 was $22.4 million with related reserves of $945,000.   approximately $16.7 million of troubled debt restructured loans are current and  accruing interest as of march31, 2013, as these loans have sufficient evidence of paying according to the new restructured terms.  total amount of troubled debt restructured loans outstanding as of december31, 2012 were $23.7 million with related reserves of $746,581.   approximately $17.7 million of troubled debt restructured loans are accruing interest as of december31, 2012,

which represents management's best estimate for probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.  the primary risks inherent in the bank's loan portfolio, including the adequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses, are based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these risks, and the related loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by direct charges to provision expense. losses on loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible. recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance for loan losses. the provision for loan losses was $237,051 for the quarter ended march31, 2013 as compared to $2.4 million for the quarter ended march 31, 2012. the provision expense is determined by management  with the use of the bank's allowance for loan losses model. the components of the model are specific reserves for impaired loans and a general allocation for unimpaired loans.  the general allocation has two components, an estimate based on historical loss experience and an additional estimate based on internal and external environmental factors due to the uncertainty of historical loss experience in predicting current embedded losses in the portfolio that will be realized in the future.  the portion of the general allocation on environmental factors includes estimates of losses related to interest rate trends, unemployment trends, real estate characteristics, past due and nonaccrual trends, watch list trends, charge-off trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.   the real estate characteristics component includes trends in real estate concentrations, exceptions to fdic guidelines for loan-to-value ratios, and changes in real estate market values.  other factors impacting the allowance at march31, 2013 were watch list trends, unemployment rate trends, and underwriting and servicing assessments.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 25table of

grouped by loan type.  the company's loan charge-off policy for all loan classes is to charge down loans to net realizable value once a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable, and the underlying collateral shortfall is assessed.  unsecured loans (primarily consumer loans) are charged off against the reserve once the loan becomes 90 days past due or it is determined that a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  secured loans (primarily construction, real estate, commercial and other loans) are moved to nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or a portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectable and supporting collateral is not considered to be sufficient to cover potential losses.  nonaccrual loans are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if all or a portion of the loan is uncollectable.  nonaccrual loans that are determined to be solely collateral dependent are promptly charged down to net realizable value upon determination that they are impaired.  in addition to the allowance for loan losses, the company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments. unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by loan classification. these classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 27table of contentseconomic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the reserve for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $177,235 and $182,489 as of march31, 2013 and december31, 2012, respectively.  the company maintains reserves for mortgage loans sold to agencies and investors in the event that, either through error or disagreement between the parties, the company is required to indemnify the purchase. the reserves take into consideration risks associated with underwriting, key factors in the mortgage industry, loans with specific reserve requirements, past due loans and potential indemnification by the company. reserves are estimated based on consideration of factors in the mortgage industry such as declining collateral values and rising levels of delinquency, default and foreclosure, coupled with increased incidents of quality reviews at all levels of the mortgage industry seeking justification for pushing back losses to loan originators and wholesalers. as of march31, 2013, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $353,582, and charges against reserves for the three months ended march31, 2013 were $83,198.  for the three months ended march31, 2013, the company recorded $(1.3) million  in negative provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on the $78.7 million in loan sales that occurred during that period, respectively.  significant reductions in reserves from prior year levels are due to the dissolution of the mortgage subsidiary, sidus, which eliminated certain liabilities and risks associated with loans previously sold by the former mortgage subsidiary.  for the three months ended march 31, 2012, the company recorded $108,986 in provision expense related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure.  charges against reserves for the three months ended march 31, 2012 were $173,553.   for the quarters ended march31, 2013 and  2012, the company did not repurchase any mortgage loans sold.  as of december31, 2012, the company had reserves for mortgage loans sold of $1.7 million related to potential repurchase and warranties exposure on approximately $9.5 billion in loans sold.11. fair valuethe company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. available-for-sale securities, interest rate swaps, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and forward sale loan commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. additionally, from time to time, the company may be required to record other assets at fair value, such as loans held-for-investment and certain other assets. these nonrecurring fair value adjustments usually involve writing the asset down to fair value or the lower of cost or market value. following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. available-for-sale investment securitiesavailable-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the new york stock exchange, u.s. treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.interest rate swapsinterest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models run by a third-party on a monthly basis.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.   as a result, the company classifies interest rate swaps as level 3.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 28table of contentsthe following table presents a rollforward of interest rate

december 31, 2012, the amount of fair value associated with these interest rate lock commitments and sale commitments was $872,844 and $(480,806), respectively.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the company classifies interest rate lock commitments as level 3.  the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end.  the company classified forward sale commitments as level 2.  there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques

servicing rightsa valuation of mortgage servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology.  similar loans are pooled together and evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings.  the present value of the future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool, calculated by a third party at least semi-annually, using assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing.   as such, the company classifies loan servicing rights as a  level 3 asset. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march

what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. the changes in fair value of the assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.  as such, the company classifies loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a level 2 asset.  at march31, 2013, the cost of the company's mortgage loans held-for-sale was less than the market value.  accordingly, the company's loans held-for-sale are carried at cost. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march 31, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.impaired loansthe company does not record loans held-for-investment at fair value on a recurring basis. however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification. the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs), market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. at march31, 2013, the majority of impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral by obtaining third-party appraisals and applying liquidity discounts.  third party appraisals are obtained at least annually for all impaired loans greater than $250,000.  the company records impaired loans as nonrecurring level 3. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.other real estate ownedother real estate owned (‚Äúoreo‚Äù) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to oreo. subsequently, oreo is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral (through appraisal processes and applying liquidity discounts and deducting expected selling costs). when the fair value of the collateral is measured due to further deterioration in the value of the oreo since initial recognition, the company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring level 3. the current carrying value of oreo at march31, 2013 is $5.4 million.  at december 31, 2012 the carrying value of oreo was $8.7 million. there have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended march31, 2013.  valuation

significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. the discount rate is determined by the third-party by obtaining third party market quotes from reuters, which handle up to 30 year swap maturities.  the company's asset liability management team periodically reviews the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company's interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments to increase if in a gain position, or decrease if in a loss position. the pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. the pull through rate is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the company's mortgage banking division.the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the company's mortgage servicing rights are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions.  the company utilizes an independent third-party to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through use of a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income based on observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 32table of contentsan estimated fair value. to assess the

market prices, prices quoted for similar instruments, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. for certain categories of loans, such as installment and commercial loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. the cost of fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale approximates the lower of cost or market as these loans are typically sold within 60 days of origination. fair values for adjustable-rate mortgages are based on quoted market prices of similar loans adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  the company applied an additional illiquidity discount in the amount of 10.0%.the carrying value of fhlb stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the fhlb stock.the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at march31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. the fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts is estimated using the present value of the projected cash flows using rates currently offered for similar deposits with similar maturities.the fair values of borrowings are based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate for debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements. the carrying values of short-term borrowings, including overnight, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and fhlb advances, approximates the fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments. the company's credit risk is not material to calculation of fair value because these borrowings are collateralized. the carrying values of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair values due to the short-term duration.interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.   fair value measurement is based on discounted cash flow models.  all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.interest rate locks and forward loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. the fair value of forward sales commitments is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.  the fair value of interest rate lock commitments is based on servicing release premium, origination income net of origination costs, and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end, typically month end.13.  business segment informationthe company has two reportable segments, including banking activities and mortgage banking activities.  the following table details the results of operations for the three months ended march31, 2013 and 2012 for bank activities and mortgage activities. during the second quarter of 2012, the company changed its reporting of mortgage activities based on the reorganization of the bank's mortgage division.  this decision was made to improve overall reporting of its mortgage banking activities which are now analyzed and reviewed as a separate and distinct business segment.  this change in reporting segment combined both mortgage activities of the bank with mortgage activities that were previously reported separately from mortgage activities provided by sidus.  reclassifications include interest income which was previously presented in other income, commission expenses recorded in salaries that are now recorded as a reduction in mortgage banking activity income, and other miscellaneous expenses previously recorded in other expenses that have been reclassified as a reduction to mortgage banking activity income.  in addition, gains on sale of mortgage loans has been reclassified to be reported with mortgage banking income to provide a combined overview of the mortgage banking activity segment.  the reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity, as previously reported.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 35table of contentsin the fourth quarter of 2012, a decision was made by management to sell a reinsurance subsidiary held by sidus.  as a result of this decision, sidus reclassified its investment in the reinsurance subsidiary to held for sale and wrote down its investment by $1.0 million to the estimated fair value at december 31, 2012.  the sale of the subsidiary closed in the first quarter of 2013.  in addition, at the beginning of 2013, the company dissolved the sidus subsidiary and is no longer doing business as sidus beginning in 2013.  as a result, all

tax asset was $28.8 million at march31, 2013 and $31.4 million at december 31, 2012.  a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  all available evidence, both positive and negative, is used in the consideration to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is required.  at march 31, 2013, the company considered the following negative and positive evidence in its evaluation of

$237,000 for the quarter.  losses for the fourth quarter of 2012 involved the sale and writedown of certain substandard and nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the amount of approximately $49 million.  the company incurred losses of approximately $35 million on loan sales and $7 million on sales of foreclosed assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the implementation of this accelerated disposition plan. excluding losses sustained in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the accelerated asset disposition plan, the company has recorded $22 million in pre-tax income for six previous consecutive quarters as credit quality has improved and net interest margin has increased over the past year.     significance:  high‚Ä¢the company is projecting income on a pretax basis, as well as taxable income, for the future periods 2013-2015.  the budgeted provision for loan losses is a key driver of the resulting income.  while management believes the 2010, 2011 and 2012 levels of provision are indicative of the worst economic downturn in recent history and will not be repeated, it is important to understand why future losses are not projected at these levels.  also, as discussed below, credit quality metrics have significantly improved.  in the three year period ended december 31, 2012, management was proactive in charging down collateral dependent loans that are impaired to current market values.   significance:  moderate‚Ä¢in 2012, the company completed a $45 million private placement offering pursuant to which several institutional investors and members of the board and management purchased shares of preferred stock.  in connection with this private placement, the company converted approximately $21 million of its outstanding series t and series t-acb preferred shares to common shares.   as of march 31, 2013, the company's leverage ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 10.0%, 12.6%, and 13.8%.  significance: moderate‚Ä¢credit quality has improved over the past twelve months, including significant decreases in classified loans and nonperforming loans.  credit losses have shown a dramatic reduction in the first quarter of 2013 and overall nonperforming loans are down $42.4 million since march 31, 2012.   nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.58% as of march 31, 2013 as compared to 4.80% as of march 31, 2012.  in addition, allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased from 45.49% at march 31, 2012 to 103.29% at march 31, 2013.  significance:  high‚Ä¢management is

greater than expected due to economic factors, including declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors;‚Ä¢reduced earnings due to higher credit losses because our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral;‚Ä¢the rate of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off;‚Ä¢the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods;‚Ä¢results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or writedown assets;‚Ä¢the amount of our loan

statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee you that these expectations will be achieved. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.overviewthe following discussion describes our results of operations for the three months ended march31, 2013  and 2012 and also analyzes our financial condition as of march31, 2013 as compared to december 31, 2012.  like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments.  our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.  consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.  another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.  we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings.  in the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.  we describe the various components of this noninterest income, as well as our noninterest expense, in the following discussion.the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements.  we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.the company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or occurrences after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 42table of contentschanges in financial

continues efforts to focus on credit quality.  the allowance for loan losses decreased $657,000 driven primarily by decreases in classified loans for the quarter ended march31, 2013, decreased charge-offs in 2013 as compared to 2012, as well as an overall decrease in loans held-for-investment. total watch list and substandard loans were $100.6 million as compared to $102.9 million as of december 31, 2012, a decrease of $2.4 million.   see note 10 above entitled ‚Äúloans and allowance for loan losses‚Äù for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses.mortgage loans held-for-sale decreased by $9.2 million, or 33.3%, from december 31, 2012 to march31, 2013 as the bank continued its strategy of selling mortgage loans mostly to various investors with servicing rights released and to a lesser extent to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation with servicing rights retained.  this decrease was the result of a smaller pipeline at march31, 2013, as well as a decrease in fair value of loan commitments.  these loans are normally held for a period of two to three weeks before being sold to investors.  mortgage loans closed in the first three months of 2013 ranged from a low of $19.4 million in february 2013 to a high of $26.9 million in january 2013 and totaled $69.5 million at march 31, 2013.  mortgage loans closed during the three months ended march 31, 2012 totaled $63.3 million. the securities portfolio increased from $343.1 million at december 31, 2012, to $380.8 million at march31, 2013, an increase of $37.7 million as excess cash received in the recent capital raise and loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2012 was invested in securities in the first quarter of 2013.  the portfolio is comprised of securities of u.s. government agencies (4.5%), mortgage-backed securities (65.1%), state and municipal securities (30.3%), and publicly traded common and preferred stocks (0.1%).  other assets increased $756,000 due largely to an increase in mortgage servicing rights of $520,000 and an increase in other prepaid expense of $332,000 offset by a $593,000 reduction in prepaid fdic expense and a $70,000 decrease in deferred commissions. oreo decreased $3.3 million as the result of sales in the amount of $5.5 million, offset by transfers in the amount of $2.3 million for the three months ended march31, 2013.  premises and equipment increased $605,000, or 1.45%.  deferred tax assets also decreased $2.6 million as the company recorded $2.6 million in income tax expense for the quarter.  see note 14 for detailed information regarding deferred tax assets.deposits decreased $70.0 million, or 4.3%, comparing march31, 2013 to december 31, 2012. overall, noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $16.5 million, or 6.0%, certificates of deposit (‚Äúcods‚Äù) over $100,000 decreased $34.5 million, or 10.9%, and other cods decreased $51.0 million, or 12.2%, while now, savings, and money market accounts increased $32.1 million, or 5.1%, management continues to focus on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand and now accounts through the use of marketing efforts and interest rates.borrowed funds decreased $6.0 million, or 5.7%, comparing march31, 2013 to december 31, 2012 as repurchase agreements decreased $6.0 million. long term borrowings included $35.0 million in trust preferred securities and advances from the fhlb of $25.3 million.  the american community merger added $10.4 million in trust preferred securities at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.80% and will mature in 2033.  yadkin valley statutory trust i (‚Äúthe trust‚Äù) issued $25.8 million in trust preferred securities at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 1.32%. the trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, and can be called by the trust without penalty. other liabilities, capital lease obligations and accrued interest payable combined decreased by $4.9 million, or 31.1%, from december 31, 2012 to march31, 2013.  decreases in other liabilities resulted primarily from a $1.7 million decrease in liability related to the sale of the reinsurance subsidiary as well as a $1.3 million reduction in reserves established for sold loans.  in addition, there was a $390,000 decrease in accrued interest payable as average deposits and borrowings have decreased year-over-year. at march31, 2013, total shareholders' equity was $174.9 million, or a book value of $3.40 per common share, compared to $170.8 million, or a book value of $3.31 per common share, at december 31, 2012.  the company's equity to assets ratio was 9.47% and 8.88%, at march31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively.  capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  in order to be considered ‚Äúwell capitalized‚Äù, a bank must exceed total risk-based capital ratios of 10%, and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6% and leverage ratios of 5%. in addition, we have committed to regulators that the bank will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8%, which is higher than the statutory tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% to be classified as well-capitalized. our goal has been to maintain a ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù status for the bank since failure to meet or exceed this classification affects how regulatory applications for certain activities, including yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 43table of contentsacquisitions, and continuation and expansion of existing activities, are evaluated and could make our customers and potential investors less confident in our bank. the following table sets forth the company's and the bank's various capital ratios as of march31, 2013 and december 31, 2012.  the company and the bank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios as of march31, 2013, as well as the ratios to be considered "well capitalized."  march 31, 2013december 31, 2012holdingcompanybankholdingcompanybanktotal risk-based capital ratio13.8%13.5%13.3%13.0%tier 1 risk-based capital ratio12.6%12.2%12.2%11.7%leverage ratio10.0%9.7%9.2%8.9%management of equity is a critical aspect of capital management in any business.  the determination of the appropriate amount of equity for a regulated financial institution is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the amount of capital needed to meet regulatory requirements, the amount of ‚Äúrisk equity‚Äù the business requires and balance sheet leverage.in june 2012, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the ‚Äúfederal reserve‚Äù) approved three notices of proposed rulemaking (‚Äúnprs‚Äù) to, among other things, implement the basel iii minimum capital requirements and capital conservation buffer. the three nprs were expected to be published jointly by the federal reserve, the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency after each agency has completed its approval process. the comment period on the nprs ended on october 22, 2012 however the nprs have been delayed in the u.s. until further notice. if approved in their current form, the nprs would be effective over a phased-in period from 2013 to 2019. we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposed rules on the company and the bank.to be categorized as well capitalized, the company and the bank each must maintain minimum amounts and ratios.  at march31, 2013, the company is well-capitalized for regulatory purposes both at the bank and holding company level, however the bank has committed to regulators that it will maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% which it exceeded at march 31, 2013. liquidity, interest rate sensitivity and market riskthe bank derives the majority of its liquidity from its core deposit base and to a lesser extent from wholesale borrowing.  the balance sheet liquidity ratio, measured by the sum of cash (less reserve requirements), investments, and loans held-for-sale reduced by pledged securities, as compared to deposits and short-term borrowings, was 22.2% at march31, 2013 compared to 23.2% at december 31, 2012.  additional liquidity is provided by $54.1 million in unused credit including federal funds purchased lines provided by correspondent banks as well as credit availability from the fhlb. in addition, the bank has unpledged marketable securities of $295.3 million available for use as a source of collateral.  at march31, 2013, brokered deposits totaled $3.1 million, or 0.2% of total deposits.  brokered certificates of deposit are primarily short-term with maturities of nine months or less.  the bank also maintains a brokered deposit now account to add municipal deposits totaling $2.9 million at march31, 2013.  the bank contracted with promontory interfinancial network ("promontory") in 2008 for various services including wholesale cod funding. promontory's cdars¬Æ product, one-way buysm, enables the bank to bid on a weekly basis through a private auction for cod terms ranging from four weeks to 260weeks (approximately five years) with settlement available each thursday.  there were no outstanding funds acquired through the one-way buy product at march31, 2013 or december 31, 2012. promontory also provides a product, cdars¬Æ reciprocal, which allows the bank's customers to place funds in excess of the fdic insurance limit with promontory's network of participating banks so that the customer is fully insured for the amount deposited. promontory provides reciprocating funds to the bank from funds placed at other banks by their customers. the bank sets its customers' interest rates when they place deposits through the network and pays/receives the rate difference to/from the other banks whose reciprocal funds are held by the bank. the overall impact of this process is that the bank effectively pays the rate offered to its relationship customer. therefore, the bank does not consider these funds to be wholesale or brokered funds. in compliance with fdic reporting requirements, the bank includes reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits in its quarterly federal financial institutions examination council call report.  cdars¬Æ reciprocal deposits totaled $165,000 at march 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 44table of contentsmanagement continues to assess interest rate risk internally and by utilizing outside sources.  the balance sheet is asset sensitive over a three-month period, meaning that there will be more assets than liabilities immediately repricing as market rates change. over a period of twelve months, the balance sheet remains slightly asset sensitive. we generally would benefit from increasing market interest rates when we have an asset-sensitive, or a positive interest rate gap, and we would generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we have liability-sensitive, or a negative interest rate gap.  the company currently has derivative instrument contracts consisting of interest rate swaps and interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages.the primary objective for each of these contracts is to minimize interest rate risk.the company's strategy is to use derivative contracts to stabilize and improve net interest margin and net interest income currently and in future periods.  the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes.  the company's exposure to market risk is reviewed regularly by management.results of operationsnet income for the quarter ended march31, 2013 was $4.6 million before preferred dividends, compared to net income of $3.5 million in the same period of 2012.  net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended march31, 2013 was $4.2 million.   net income to common shareholders for the three month period ended march31, 2012 was $2.7 million.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.10 for the three month period ended march31, 2013.  basic and diluted income per common share were $0.14 for the three month period ended march31, 2012.  on an annualized basis, first quarter results represent a return on average assets of 0.91% at march31, 2013 compared to 0.54% at march31, 2012, and a return on average equity of 9.94% compared to 6.48% at march31, 2012.  certain income and expense items have been reclassified for the three months ended march31, 2013 and 2012 for comparability due to a change in the company's mortgage banking segment reporting as of march31, 2013.net interest incomenet interest income, the largest contributor to earnings, decreased $838,000, or 5.3%, to $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared with $15.9 million in the same period of 2012.  the overall decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on loans of 11.9% as average loan balances are down 8% from the prior year and loan yields are declining as loans reprice at lower rates.  this decrease in net interest income was offset by a 37% decrease in interest expense as higher costs time deposits have decreased 11.7% since december 31, 2012.  the net interest margin increased to 3.57% in the first quarter of 2013 from 3.55% in the first quarter of 2012.    the increase in net interest margin is primarily related to a decrease in deposit yields and borrowings cost.  deposit yields have decreased as management focused efforts on shifting the deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing now and money market accounts.   the company maintains an asset-sensitive position with respect to the impact of changing rates on net interest income.  yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 45table of contentsthree months ended march 31, 2013three months ended march 31,

lossesadequacy of the allowance or reserve for loan losses of the bank is a significant estimate that is based on management's assumptions regarding, among other factors, general and local economic conditions, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the bank's control.  in estimating these loss reserve levels, management also considers the financial conditions of specific borrowers and credit concentrations with specific borrowers, groups of borrowers, and industries.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 46table of contentsthe allowance for loan losses was $24.5 million at march31, 2013, or 1.88% of loans held-for-investment, as compared to $25.1 million, or 1.92% of loans held-for-investment, at december31, 2012.  decreases in the allowance for loan losses were due to decreased charge-offs in the first three months of 2013, decreased criticized loans and an overall decrease in gross loans since december 31, 2012.  decreases in criticized loans were due to improvements in loans 30-89 days past due, payoffs and overall improvements in underlying credit exposures.   the allowance model is applied to the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the specific allowance balance for impaired loans and the general allowance balance for performing loans grouped by loan type.  out of the $24.5 million in total allowance for loan losses at march31, 2013, the specific allowance for impaired loans accounted for $2.1 million, up from $1.4 million at year end as two new relationships were added to nonaccrual status during the first quarter and additional reserves were needed.  see discussion below  in "nonperforming assets" for further discussion of nonaccrual relationships.  the remaining general allowance, $22.4 million, was attributed to performing loans and was down from $23.8 million at year end.  the general allowance, as a percent of loans not individually reviewed for impairment was 1.76% as of march31, 2013 as compared to 1.86% as of december31, 2012.  the decrease in the general allowance was driven primarily by a decrease in charge-offs, as well as a decrease in substandard and watch loans of $2.4 million which resulted from additional impairments loans, for which specific allowances are now calculated, as well as a few significant payoffs and improvements in past dues and underlying credit exposures of previously classified loans. also contributing to the decrease in the general allowance for loan losses was a 0.4% decrease in gross loans as of march 31, 2013 as compared to december 31, 2012. these decreases in allowances led to decreased provisions in many of the loan types including negative provisions for the three months ended march 31, 2013 for construction and 1-4 family mortgage loans as nonaccruals and classified loans in these categories decreased.net loan charge offs were $894,000, or 0.27% (annualized), of average loans, for the three months ended march31, 2013 compared to $5.1 million, or 1.44% (annualized), of average loans for the three months ended march 31, 2012.  decrease in charge-offs is related to a significant decrease in problem loans over the past 12 months.  charge-offs over the past 3 years have been elevated due to declines in real estate values and overall economic conditions.  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the bank's loan portfolio as of march31, 2013. no assurance can be given in this regard, however, especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in the bank's market areas. management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and will consider future changes to the allowance that may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions.  additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the bank's allowance for loan losses.  such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses. the downturn experienced in the real estate market from 2008-2011 resulted in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures . in some cases, that downturn resulted in significant impairments to the value of collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends, liquidation value trends, and other liquidation expenses to determine logical and credible discounts that may be needed.  management aggressively monitors its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with significant weaknesses.  the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. if real estate values begin to decline in the future, it is more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and our net charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. assurances cannot be made either (1) that further charges to the allowance account will not be significant in relation to the normal activity or (2) that further evaluation of the loan portfolio based on prevailing conditions may not require sizable additions to the allowance and charges to provision expense. our real estate portfolio has approximately $133.2 million of construction loans, $562.4 million of commercial real estate loans, $166.6 million in first lien mortgage loans, $193.4 million in home equity lines of credit and $34.4 million in multifamily mortgage loans as of march31, 2013. we consider our construction and junior lien mortgage loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio.  construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed into properties such as sub-divisions or speculative houses. normally, these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the developed property.  in addition, management continues to evaluate closely junior lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.  given the slow economic recovery, and slow to recover real estate values, the company recognizes that it may experience some loss in these portfolios, and management continues to monitor borrower financials,  ltvs, and first lien positions.   the significance of both construction and commercial real estate loans to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due.   loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is past due 90 days or when it is apparent that the collection of principal and/or interest is doubtful.  net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 47table of contentscommercial real estate loans were $130,000 and $185,000, respectively, for the three months ended march31, 2013.  for the three months ended march 31, 2012, net charge-offs (recoveries) of construction and commercial real estate loans were $1.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.   as of march31, 2013, $5.6 million of our real estate loans had interest reserves including both borrower and bank funded, compared to $9.8 million as of december 31, 2012.  there is a risk that an interest reserve could mask problems with a borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt consistent with the terms and conditions of the loan obligation, therefore the company has implemented review policies and internal controls to identify and monitor all loans with interest reserves.  nonperforming assetstotal nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due but still accruing, and foreclosed real estate) decreased from $31.6 million at december 31, 2012 to $29.2 million at march31, 2013.  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.58% as of march31, 2013 as compared to 1.64% as of december 31, 2012, due primarily to a decrease in foreclosed real estate since december 31, 2012 as the company sold over $5 million in foreclosed properties in a recent auction.  total nonaccrual loans increased slightly from $22.8 million, or 1.71% of total loans, at december 31, 2012 to $23.7 million, or 1.79% of total loans, at march31, 2013.  the increases in nonaccrual was due to one large heloc that went past due 90 days and a loan for a large commercial parcel that has deteriorated since year end and is in the process of foreclosure.   we have analyzed our nonperforming loans to determine what we believe is the amount needed to reserve in the allowance for loan losses based on an assessment of the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan.   we have downgraded loans for which the probability of collection is uncertain and written down oreo property values where net realizable values have declined.  specific allowance for nonperforming loans accounted for $2.1 million, down from $1.4 million at year end, due to the charge-off of collateral dependent impaired loans to fair value.approximately 53% of loans in nonaccrual status are currently not past due 30 days or more. the total number of loans on nonaccrual has decreased from 315 to 207 since december 31, 2012. the average nonaccrual loan balance is $112,000 and $71,000 as of march31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. at march31, 2013, 87% of the nonaccrual loans were secured by  real estate.the largest amount of nonaccrual loans for one customer relationship totaled $3.4 million. this relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase and refinance of real estate, acquisition of equipment and related operating expenses. this relationship currently has a reserve of $799,003 as of march 31, 2013. nonaccrual loans also include three other large relationships each totaling $1.8 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively as of march 31, 2013. the first of these nonaccrual relationships consists of one loan that was originally used for working capital purposes and is secured by real estate, account receivables, inventory and equipment. this loan currently has a reserve of $118,014 assigned to it as of march 31, 2013. the second relationship was originally used to purchase and develop a residential tract of land and does not have any specific reserves as of march 31, 2013. the third relationship consists of various loans, the proceeds of which were utilized for the purchase of two businesses and secured by the real estate. this relationship does not have any specific reserve assigned to it as of march 31, 2013. all of these loans have been placed in nonaccrual status because of concerns for the customers' continued ability to pay, collateral deterioration and depressed future industry outlook.noninterest incomenoninterest income consists of all revenues that are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets.  total noninterest income increased approximately $2.1 million, or 61.2%, comparing the first quarters of 2013 and 2012.   this increase was primarily related to an increase in mortgage banking income of $2.1 million, or 188.7% which resulted primarily from $1.3 million in negative provisions related to reserves on sold loans.  other changes in noninterest income include the following:  ‚Ä¢service charges on deposit accounts increased by $25,000, or 2.0%, as service charges on business checking accounts increased $40,000.  this increase was offset partially by a $8,000 decrease in nsf and odp charges.‚Ä¢other service fees increased $33,000 when comparing the first quarter of 2013 to the prior year due primarily to an increase of $68,000 in commissions and fees on annuity and mutual fund sales.  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in atm and debit card fee income of $43,000.  ‚Ä¢net gain on sale of investment securities increased $4,000 due to the sale of one security.yadkin valley financial corporationform 10-q quarterly report march 31, 2013 48table of contents‚Ä¢income on investment in bank-owned life insurance (‚Äúboli‚Äù) decreased by

million in negative provisions related to mortgage loans sold and mortgage production increased when comparing 2013 and 2012.   in addition, servicing income including fair market value adjustment for mortgage servicing rights also increased from the prior year.‚Ä¢other income decreased by approximately $20,000, or 26.7%, for the quarter.  prior year other income included rental income received on other real estate owned.  many of those properties have been sold in 2013.noninterest expensetotal noninterest expenses were $13.2 million for the first quarter of 2013, compared to $13.6 million in the same period of 2012, a decrease of $363,000, or 2.7%.   noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and all other operating costs.  noninterest expense to average assets for the quarter ended march31, 2013 and 2012 was 0.70%, and 0.69%, respectively.  efficiency ratios for the three months ended march31, 2013 and 2012 were 66.40% and 63.51%,

risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending, deposit, and borrowing activities.  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  in addition to other risks that we manage in the normal course of business, such as credit quality and liquidity, management
